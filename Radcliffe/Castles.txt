ATHLIN any DUNBAYNE. 


N- the north-eaſt coaſt of Scotland, 
Ein the moſt romantic part of the 
Highlands, ſtood the caſtle of Athlin; 
an edifice built on the ſummit of a 
rock whoſe baſe was in the fea. This 
pile was venerable from its antiquity, 
and from its gothic ſtructure; but more 
venerable from the virtues which it 
encloſed. It was the reſidence of the 


$111 beautiful widow, and the children, 
B of 


( $-1 


of the noble Earl of Athlin, who was 
ſlain by the hand of Malcolm, a neigh- 
bouring chief, proud, oppreſſive, re- 
vengeful; and ſtill reſiding in all the 
pomp of feudal greatneſs, within a few 
miles of the caſtle of Athlin. Encroach- 
ment on the domain of Athlin, was 
the occaſion of the animoſity which 
ſubſiſted between the chiefs. Frequent 
broils had happened between their 
clans, in which that of Athlin had 
generally been victorious. Malcolm, 
whoſe pride was touched by the defeat 
| of his people; whoſe ambition was 
| curbed by the authority, and whoſe 
| . greatneſs was rivalled by the power of 
the Earl, conceived for him that deadly 
hatred which oppoſition to its favourite 
| paſſions naturally excites in a mind 
| like his, haughty and unaccuſtomed to 
| controul; and he meditated his deſtruc- 
tion. He planned his purpoſe with | 
all that addreſs which ſo eminently 2 
marked his character, and in a battle

which was attended by the chiefs of 
each party in perſon, he contrived, by 
a curious fineſſe, to entrap the Earl, 
accompanied by a ſmall detachment, in 
his wiles, and there flew him. A gene- 
ral rout of his clan enſued, which 
was followed by a dreadful ſlaughter ; 
and a few only eſcaped to tell the horrid 
cataſtrophe to Matilda. Matilda, over- 
whelmed by the news, and deprived of 
thoſe numbers which would make re- 
venge ſucceſsful, forbore to ſacrifice the 
lives of her few remaining people to a 
_ feeble attempt at retaliation, and ſhe 
was conſtrained to endure in filence 
her ſorrows and her injuries. 


Inconſolable for his death, Matilda 
had withdrawn from the public eye, 
into this ancient ſeat of feudal govern- 
1 ment, and there, in the boſom of her 
people and her family, had devoted 
herſelf to the education of her chil- 
dren. One ſon and one daughter were

all that ſurvived to her care, and their 
growing virtues promiſed to repay all 
her tenderneſs. Oſbert was in his nine- 
teenth year: nature had given him a 
mind ardent and ſuſceptible, to which 


education had added refinement and 


expanſion. The viſions of genius were 


bright in his imagination, and his heart, 


unchilled by the touch of diſappoint- 
ment, glowed with all the warmth of 


benevolence, 


When firſt we enter on the the- 


atre of the world, and begin to no- 


tice its features, young imagina- 
tion heightens every ſcene, and the 
warm heart expands to all around it. 
The happy benevolence of our feelings 
prompts us to believe that every body 
is good, and excites our wonder why 


every body is not happy. We are fired 


with indignation at the recital of an act 
of injuſtice, and at the unfeeling vices 


of which we are told. At a tale of

As we advance in life, imagination is 
compelled to relinquiſh a part of her 
{ſweet delirium ; we are led reluctantly 


to truth through the paths of expe-

Mary, who was juſt ſeventeen, had 


the accompliſhments of riper years, 
with the touching ſimplicity of youth. 


The graces of her perſon were inferior 


only to thoſe of her mind, which illu- 
mined her countenance with inimitable

Twelve years had now elapſed ſince 


the death of the Earl, and time had 


blunted the keen edge of ſorrow. Ma- 
tilda's grief had declined into a gentle, 
and not unpleaſing melancholy, which 
gave a ſoft and intereſting ſhade to the 
natural dignity of her character. Hi- 
therto her attention had been ſolely

and ſtrength. A new hope, and new 
ſolicitudes, now aroſe in her breaſt: 


theſe dear children were arrived at an 
age, dangerous from its tender ſuſcep- 
tibility, and from the influence which 
imagination has at that time over the 
paſſions. Impreſſions would foon be 
formed which would ftamp their deſtiny 
for life. The anxious mother lived 
but in her children, and ſhe had yet 
another cauſe of apprehenſion. 


When Oſbert learned the ſtory of his 
father's death, his young heart glowed 
to avenge the deed. The late Earl, 


who had governed with the real dignity 


of power, was adored by his clan ; they 
were eager to revenge his injuries; 
but oppreſſed by the generous com- 
paſſion of the Counteſs, their murmurs 
ſunk into ſilence : yet they fondly che- 
riſhed the hope that their young Lord 
would one day lead them on to conqueſt 
and revenge. The time was now come 

"4. when 


tt MR. ol e

when they looked to ſee this hope, the 
ſolace of many a cruel moment, realized. 


The tender fears of a mother would not 
ſuffer Matilda to riſque the chief of her 


laſt remaining comforts. She forbade 


Oſbert to engage. He ſubmitted in 
ſilence, and endeavoured, by application 
to his favourite ſtudies, to ſtifle the 


emotions which rouſed him to arms. 
He excelled in the various accompliſh- 


ments of his rank, but chiefly in the 
martial exerciſes, for they were conge- 


nial to the nobility of his foul, and he 


had a ſecret pleaſure in believing, that 
they would one time aſſiſt him to do 
juſtice to the memory of his dead father. 
His warm imagination directed him to 


poetry, and he followed where ſhe led. 


He loved to wander among the roman- 
tic ſcenes of the Highlands, where the 
wild variety of nature inſpired him with 
all the enthuſiaſm of his favourite art. 


He delighted in the terrible and in the 
grand, more than in the ſofter landſcape ; 


and, 


C 1 


and, wrapt in the bright viſions of 
fancy, would often loſe himſelf in 
awful ſolitudes. 


It was in one of theſe rambles, that 
having ſtrayed for ſome miles over hills 
covered with heath, from whence the 
eye was preſented with only the bold 
outlines of uncultivated nature, rocks 
piled on rocks, cataracts and vaſt moors 
unmarked by the foot of traveller, he 
loſt the path which he had himſelf 
made; he looked. in vain for the ob- 
jects which had directed him, and his 
heart, for the firſt time, felt the repulſe 
of fear, No veſtige of a human being 
was to be ſeen, and the dreadful ſilence 
of the place was interrupted only by the 
roar of diſtant torrents, and by the 
ſcreams of the birds which flew over his 
head. He ſhouted, and his voice was 
anſwered only by the deep echos of the 
mountains, He remained for ſome time

but which was ſoon heightened to a 
degree of terror not to be endured; 
and he turned his ſteps backward, 
forlorn, and dejected. Fis memory 
gave. him back no image of the paſt; 
having wandered ſome time, he came 
to a narrow paſs, which he entered, 
overcome with fatigue and fruitleſs 
ſearch: he had not advanced far, when 
an abrupt opening in the rock ſuddenly 
preſented him with a view of the moſt 
beautifully romantic ſpot he had ever 


ſeen. It was a valley almoſt ſurrounded 


by a barrier of wild rocks, whoſe baſe 
was ſhaded with thick woods of pine 
and fir. A torrent, which tumbled from 
the heights, and was ſcen between the 
woods, ruſhed with amazing impe- 
tuoſity into a fine lake which flowed 


through the vale, and was loſt in the 


deep receſſes of the mountains. Herds 
of cattle grazed in the bottom, and 
the delighted eyes of Oſbert were once 
more bleſſed with the ſight of human 

dwel- 


CI 3 


dwellings. Far on the margin of the 
ſtream were ſcattered a few neat cot- 
tages. His heart was ſo gladdened at 
the proſpect, that he forgot he had yet 
the way to find which led to this Ely- 
ſian vale. He was juſt awakened to this 
diſtreſſing 1cality, when his attention 
was once more engaged by the manly 
figure of a young Highland peaſant, 
who advanced towards him with an air 
of benevolence, and, having learned his 
diſtreſs, offered to conduct him to his 
cottage. Oſbert accepted the invita- 
tion, and they wound down the hill, 
through an obſcure and intricate path, 
together. They arrived at one of the 
cottages which the Earl had obſerved 
from the height; they entered, and the 
peaſant preſented his gueſt to a venera- 
ble old Highlander, his father, Refreſh- 
ments were ſpread on the table by 
a pretty young girl, and Oſbert, after 


having j partook of them and reſted 


oats departed, accompanied by Al- 
B 6 leyn, 


6 
leyn, the young peaſant, who had offered 
to be his guide. The length of the 
walk vas beguiled by converſation. 
Oſbert was intereſted by diſcovering in 
his companion a dignity of thought, and 
a courſe of ſentiment ſimilar to his 


own. On their way, they paſſed at 


ſome diſtance the caſtle of Dunbayne. 
This object gave to Oſbert a bitter 
reflection, and drew from him a deep 
ſigh. Alleyn made obſervations on the 
bad policy of oppreſſion in a chief, 
and produced as an inſtance the Baron 
Malcolm. Theſe lands, faid he, are 
his, and they are ſcarcely ſufficient 
to ſupport his wretched people, who, 


ſinking under ſevere exactions, ſuffer 


to lie uncultivated, tracts which would 
otherwiſe yield riches to their Lord, 


His clan, oppreſſed by their burdens, 
threaten to riſe and do juſtice to them 


ſelves by force of arms, The Baron, 
in haughty confidence, laughs at their 
defiance, and is inſenſible to his dan-

ger; for ſhould an inſurrection hap- 


pen, there are other clans who would 
eagerly join in his deſtruction, and 
puniſh with the ſame weapon the tyrant 
and the murderer. Surpriſed at the 
bold independence of theſe words, de- 
livered with uncommon energy, the 
heart of Oſbert beat quick, and © O 
God! my father!” burſt from his lips. 
Alleyn ſtood aghaſt! uncertain of the 
effect which his ſpeech had produced; 
in an inſtant the whole truth flaſhed upon 
his mind: He beheld the ſon of the 
Lord whom he had been taught to love, 
and whole ſad_ ſtory had been impreſſed 
upon his. heart in the early days of child- 
hood; he ſunk at his feet, and em- 
braced his knees with a romantic ardor. 
The young Earl raiſed him from the 
ground, and the following words re- 
lieved him from his aſtoniſhment, and 
filled his eyes with tears of mingled joy 
and ſorrow: © There are other clans 
as ready as your own to avenge the 


wrongs 


( 14 ) 
wrongs of the noble Earl of Athlin; 
the Fitz-Henrys were ever friends to 
virtue.” The countenance of the youth, 
while he ſpoke, was overſpread with 
the glow of conſcious dignity, and his 
eyes were animated with the pride of 
virtue. The breaſt of Oſbert kindled 
with the noble purpoſe, but the image 
of his weeping mother croſſed his mind, 
and checked the ardor of the impulſe. 
« A time may come my friend,” ſaid 


he, © when your generous zeal will be 


accepted with the warmth of gratitude 
it deſerves. Particular circumſtances 


will not ſuffer me, at preſent, to ſay 


more. The warm attachment of Al- 


leyn to his father ſunk oy in his 


heart, 


It was evening before they reached the 
caſtle, and Alleyn remained the Earl's 
gueſt for that night.

CHAPTER l. 


&amp; yan following day was appointed 
a for the celebration of an annual 
feſtival given by the Earl to his people, 
and he would not ſuffer Alleyn to de- 
part. The hall was ſpread with tables ; 
and dance and merriment reſounded 
through the caſtle. It was uſual on 
that day for the clan to aſſemble in 
arms, on account of an attempt, the 


memory of which it was meant to per- 


petuate, made, two centuries before, by 
an hoſtile clan to ſurprize them in their 
feſtivity. 


In the morning were performed the 
martial exerciſes, in which emulation 
was excited by the honorary rewards 
beſtowed on excellence. The Counteſs 
and her lovely daughter, beheld, from 
the ramparts of the caſtle, the feats 
performed on the plains below. Their

attention was engaged, and their cu- 
rioſity excited by the appearance of a 
ſtranger, who managed the lance and 
the bow with ſuch exquiſite dexterity, 
as to bear off each prize of chivalry, It 
was Alleyn. He received the palm of 
victory, as was uſual, from the hands 
of the Earl; and the modeſt dignity 
with which he accepted it, charmed 


the beholders. 


The Earl honoured the feaſt with his 
preſence, at the concluſion of which, 
each gueſt aroſe, and ſeizing his goblet 
with his left hand, and with his right 
ſtriking his ſword, drank to the memory 
of their departed Lord. The hall 
echoed with the general voice, Oſbert 
felt it ſtrike upon his heart the alarum 
of war. The people then joined hands, 
and drank to the honour of the ſon 
of their late maſter. Ofſbert under. 
ſtood the fignal, and overcome with 


emotion, every conſideration yielded to. 
that

that of avenging his father. He aroſe, 
and harangued the clan with all the fire 
of youth and of indignant virtue. As he 
ſpoke, the countenance of his people 
flaſhed with impatient joy; a deep mur- 
mur of applauſe ran through the aſſem- 
bly ; and when he was filent, each man, 


croſſing his ſword with that of his 


neighbour, ſwore by that ſacred pledge 
of union, never to quit the cauſe in 
which they now engaged, till the life 
of their enemy had paid the debt of 
juſtice and of revenge. 


In the evening, the wives and daugh- 
ters of the peaſantry came to the caſtle, 
and joined in the feſtivity. It was uſual 
for the Counteſs and her ladies to 
obſerve from a gallery of the hall, the 


various performances of dance and ſong ; 


and it had been a cuſtom of old for the 
daughter of the caſtle to grace the oc- 
caſion by performing a Scotch dance 
with the victor of the morning. This 

victor 


6 
victor now was Alleyn, who bcheld 
the lovely Mary led by the Earl into the 
hall, and preſented to him as his part- 
ner in the dance. She received his 
homage with a ſweet grace. She was 
dreſſed in the habit of a Highland laſs, _ 
[| and her fine auburn treſſes, which waved 
1 in her neck, were ornamented only with 
F a wreath of roſes. She moved in the 
dance with the light ſteps of the Graces. 
[| Profound ſilence reigned through the

1 hall during the performance, and a ſoft

fi gallery, and the night concluded in 
1 joy to all but the Earl, and to Alleyn; 


1 but very different was the ſource and 
[ the complexion of their inquietude.

dreaded the effect which the communi- 


cation of his deſigns might have on the 
tender heart of Matilda: on the mor- 
row, however, he reſolved to acquaint 
her with them, and in a few days to 
riſe and proſecute his cauſe with arms. 


Alleyn, whoſe boſom, till now, had 


felt only for others' pains, began to be 


conſcious of his own. His mind, uneaſy 
and reſtlefs, gave him only the image 
of the high-born Mary; he endea- 
voured to exclude her idea, but with 
an effort ſo faint, that it would ſtill 
intrude! Pleaſed, yet ſad, he would 
not acknowledge, even to himſelf, that 
he loved; ſo ingenious are we to con- 
ceal every appearance of evil from our- 
ſelves. He aroſe with the dawn, and 
departed from the caſtle full of grati- 
tude and ſecret love, to prepare his 
friends for the approaching war. 


The Earl awoke from broken ſlum- 
| bers,

bers, and ſummoned all his fortitude to 
encounter the tender oppoſition of his 
mother. He entered her apartment 
with faultering ſteps, and his counte- 
nancebetrayed the emotions of his ſoul. 
Matilda was ſoon informed of what. 
her heart had forcboded, and overcome 
with dreadful ſenſation, funk lifeleſs 
in her chair. Oſbert flew to her aſ- 
fiſtance, and Mary and the attendants 
ſoon recovered her to ſenſe and wretch- 
edneſs. | 


The mind of Oſbert was torn by 
the moſt cruel conflict: filial duty, ho- 
nour, revenge, commanded. him to go; 
filial love, regret, and pity, entreated. 
him to ſtay. Mary fell at his feet, and 
claſping his knees with all the wild 
energy of grief, beſought him to relin- 
quiſh his fatal purpoſe, and ſave his 
laſt ſurviving parent. Her tears, her 
ſighs, and the ſoft ſimplicity of her 
air, ſpoke a yet ſtronger language than

hear tongue: but the ſilent grief of the 
Counteſs was ſtill more touching, and 
in his endeavours to ſooth her, he was 
on the point of yielding his reſolution, 
when the figure of his dying father 
aroſe to his imagination, and ſtamped 
his purpoſe irrevocably. The anxiety of 
a fond mother, preſented Matilda with 
the image of her ſon bleeding and 
ghaſtly; and the death of her Lord was 
revived in her memory with all the 
agonizing grief that ſad event had im- 
preſſed upon her heart, the harſher 
characters of which, the lenient hand 


of time had almoſt obliterated. So 


lovely is Pity in all her attitudes, that 
fondneſs prompts us to believe ſhe can 
never tranſgreſs; but ſhe changes into a 
vice, when ſhe overcomes the purpoſes 
of ſtronger virtue. Sterner principles 
now nerved the breaſt of Oſbert againſt 
her influence, and impelled him on to 
deeds of arms. He ſummoned a few of 
the moſt able and truſty of the clan, and 

1 held 


A

held a council of war; in which it 


was reſolved that Malcolm ſhould be 


attacked with all the force they could 
aſſemble, and with all the ſpeed which 
the importance of the preparation would 
allow. To prevent ſuſpicion and alarm 
to the Baron, it was agreed it ſhould be 
given out, that theſe preparations were 
intended for aſſiſtance to the Chief of a 
diſtant part. That, when they ſet out 
on the expedition, they ſhould purſue, 
for ſome time, a contrary way, but 
under favour of the night ſhould ſud- 
denly change their route, and turn upon 
the caſtle of Dunbayne. 


In the mean time, Alleyn was ſtre- 


nuous in exciting his friends to the 
cauſe, and ſo ſucceſsful in the under- 
taking, as to have collected, in a few 
days, a number of no inconſiderable 
conſequence. To the warm enthuſiaſm 
of virtue was now added a new motive 
of exertion. It was no longer ſimply

an attachment to the cauſe of juſtice, 


which rouſed him to action; the pride 
of diſtinguiſhing himſelf in the eyes 
of his miſtreſs, and of deſerving her 


eſteem by his zealous ſervices, gave 


combined force to the firſt impulſe 
of benevolence. The ſweet thought of 
deſerving her thanks, operated ſecretly 
on his ſoul, for he was yet ignorant 
of its influence there. In this ſtate he 
again appeared at the caſtle, and told the 
Earl, that himſelf and his friends were 
ready to follow him whenever the ſignal 
ſhould be given. His offer was accepted 
with the warmth of kindneſs it claimed, 
and he was defired to hold himſelf in 
readineſs for the onſet. 


In a few days the preparations were 
completed, Alleyn and his friends were 
ſummoned, the clan aſſembled in arms, 
and, with the young Earl at their head, 
departed on their expedition. The 
parting between Oſbert and his family

may be eaſily conceived; nor could 
all the pride of expected conqueſt ſup- 
preſs a ſigh which eſcaped from Alleyn 
when his eyes bade adieu to Mary, 
who, with the Counteſs, ſtood on the 
terrace of the caſtle, purſuing with 
aching ſight the march of her beloved 
brother, till diſtance veiled him from 
her view; ſhe then turned into the caſtle 


weeping, and foreboding future cala- 


mity. She endeavoured, however, to 
aſſume an appearance of tranquillity, 
that ſhe might deceive the fears of 
Matilda, and ſooth her ſorrow. Ma- 
tilda, whoſe mind was ſtrong as her 
heart was tender, ſince ſhe could not 
prevent this hazardous undertaking, 
ſummoned all her fortitude to reſiſt 
the impreſſions of fruitleſs grief, and 
to ſearch for the good which the occa- 
ſion might preſent. Her efforts were 
not vain; ſhe found it in the proſpect 
which the enterprize afforded of honour 


to the memory of her murdered Lord, 
and

and of retribution on the head of the 
murderer. 


It was evening when the Earl de- 
parted from the caſtle; he purſued a 
contrary route till night favoured his 
deſigns, when he wheeled towards the 
caſtle of Dunbayne. The extreme 
darkneſs of the night aſſiſted their plan, 
which was to ſcale the walls, ſurprize 
the centinels; burſt their way into the 
inner courts ſword in hand, and force 
the murderer from his retreat. They 
had trod for many miles the dreary 
wilds, unaſſiſted by the leaſt gleam 
of light, when ſuddenly their ears were 
ſtruck with the diſmal note of a watch- 
bell, which chimed the hour of the 
night. Every heart beat to the found. 
They knew they were near the abode 
of the Baron. They halted to conſult 
concerning their proceedings, when it 
was agreed, that the Earl, with Al- 
leyn and a choſen few, ſhould proceed 

GC to

to reconnoitre the caſtle, while the reſt 
ſhould remain at a ſmall diſtance await- 
ing the ſignal of approach: The Earl 
and his party purſued their march with 


ſilent ſteps ; they perceived a faint light, 


which they guefled to proceed from 


the watch-tower of the caſtle, and 


they were now almoſt under its walls: 


They pauſed awhile in filence to give 


breath to expectation, and to liſten if 
any thing was ſtirring. All was in- 


volved in the gloom of night, and 


the ſilence of death prevailed. They 


had now time to examine, as well as 


the darkneſs would permit, the ſitua- 
tion of the caſtle, and the height of 
the walls; and to prepare for the aſſault. 
The edifice was built with gothic mag- 
nificence upon a high and dangerous 
rock. Its lofty towers ſtill frowned in 
proud ſublimity, and the immenſity of 
the pile ſtood a record of the ancient 
conſequence of its poſſeſſors. The rock 


was ſurrounded by a ditch, broad, but

bridges, one on the north ſide, the 
other on the eaſt; they were both 
up, but as they ſeparated in the center, 
one half of the bridge remained on 
the ſide of the plains. The bridge on 
the north led to the grand gateway of 
the caſtle; that on the eaſt to a ſmall 
watch- tower: theſe were all the en- 
trances. The rock vas almoſt per- 
pendicular with the walls, which were 


ſtrong and lofty. After ſurveying the 


ſituation, they pitched upon a ſpot where 
the rock appeared moſt acceſſible, and 
which was contiguous to the principal 
gate, and gave ſignal to the clan. They 
approached in filence, and . gently 
throwing down the bundles of fag- 
got, which they had brought for the 
purpoſe, into the ditch, made them=- 
{ſelves a bridge over which they paſſed 


in ſafety, and prepared to aſcend the 


heights. It had been reſolved that a 
party, of which Alleyn was one, ſhould

ſcale the walls, ſurprize the centinels, 
and open the gates to the reſt of the 
clan, which, with the Earl, were to 
remain without. Alleyn was the firſt 


who fixed his ladder and mounted ; 
he was inſtantly followed by the reſt of 


his party, and with much difficulty, 


and ſome hazard, they gained the ram- 
parts in ſafety. They traverſed a part 
of the platform without hearing the 
found of a voice or a ſtep; profound 
ſleep ſeemed to bury all. A number 
of the party approached ſome centinels 
who were aſleep on their poſt; them 
they ſeized ; while Alleyn, with a few 
others, flew to open the neareſt gate, 
and to let down the drawbridge. This 
they accompliſhed; but in the mean 
time the ſignal of ſurprize was given, 
and inſtantly the alarm bell rang out, 
and the caſtle reſounded with the clang 
of arms. All was tumult and confu- 
fion. The Earl, with part of his peo-

tude, which poured in torrents from 
every receſs of the caſtle. Surprized, 
but not daunted, the Earl ruſhed for- 
ward ſword in hand, and fought with 
a deſperate valour. The ſoul of Alleyn 
ſeemed to acquire new vigour from the 
conflict; he fought like a man panting 
for honour, and certain of victory; 
wherever he ruſhed, conqueſt flew be- 
fore him. He, with the Earl, forced his 
way into the inner courts, in ſearch of 
the Baron, and hoped to have ſatisfied 
a juſt revenge, and to have concluded 
the conflict with the death of the 
murderer; but the moment in which 
they entered the courts, the gates were 
cloſed upon them; they were environed 
by a band of guards ; and, after a ſhort

refiſtance, in which Alleyn received a 
ſlight wound, they were ſeized as pri- 
ſoners of war. The ſlaughter without was 
great and dreadful : the people of the Ba- 
ron inſpired with fury, were inſatiate for 
death; many of the Earls followers were 


killed in the courts and on the platform ;. 


many, in attempting to eſcape, were 
thrown from the ramparts, and many 


were deſtroyed by the ſudden raiſing of 


the bridge. A ſmall part, only, of 
the. brave and adventurous band who 
had engaged in the cauſe of juſtice, and 
who were driven back from the walls, 
ſurvived to carry the dreadful tidings to 
the Counteſs. The fate of the Earl 
remained unknown. The conſternation 
among the friends of the ſlain is not 
to be deſcribed, and it was. heightened 
by the unaccountable manner in which 
the victory had been obtained ; for it was 
well known that Malcolm had never, 


but when war made it neceſſary, more

pomp demanded ; yet on this occaſion, 
a number of armed men ruſhed from 
the receſſes of his caſtle, ſufficient to 
overpower the force of a whole clan. 
But they knew not the ſecret means of 
intelligence which the Baron poſſeſſed; 
the jealouſy of conſcience had armed 
him with apprehenſion for his ſafety; 
and for ſome years he had planted ſpies 
near the caſtle of Athlin, to obſerve all 
that paſſed within it, and to give him 
immediate intelligence of every warlike 
preparation. A tranſaction ſo ſtriking, 
and ſo public as that which had oc- 
curred on the day of the feſtival, when 
the whole people ſwore to avenge the 
murder of their Chief, it was not pro- 
bable would eſcape the vigilant eye of 
his merccnaries : the circumſtance had 
been communicated to him with all the 
exaggerations of fear and wonder, and 
had given him the ſignal for defence.

The accounts ſent him of the military 


preparations which were forming, con- 
vinced him that this defence would 
ſoon be called for; and, laughing at the 
idle tales which were told him of diſtant 
wars, he haſtened to ſtore his garriſon 
with arms and with men, and held him- 
felf in readineſs to receive the aſſailants. 
The Baron had conducted his plans with 
all that power of contrivance which the 


ſecrecy of the buſineſs demanded; and 
it was his deſign to ſuffer the enemy to 


mount his walls, and to put them to 
the ſword, when the purpoſe of this 
deep-laid ſtratagem had been nearly 
defeated by the drowſineſs of the cen- 
tinels who were poſted to give ſignal of 


their approach.

her daughter. Theſe tender cares, how- 
ever, were not ineffectual; ſhe revived, 

and they aſſiſted to ſupport her in the

unknown fate of the Earl occaſioned. 
Mary, who felt all the horrors of the

office of a comforter ; but her generous

CHAPTER III. 
1 Earl, after being loaded with 


fetters, was conducted to the chief 
priſon of the caſtle, and left alone 


to the bitter reflections of defeat and 


uncertain deſtiny; but misfortune, 
though it might ſhake, could not over- 
come his firmneſs; and hope had not 
yet entirely forſaken him. It is the 


peculiar attribute of great minds, te 


bear up with encreaſing force againſt 


the ſhock of mis fortune; with them the 


nerves of reſiſtance ſtrengthen with at- 


tack; and they may be ſaid to ſubdue 
adverſity with her own weapons. 


Reflection, at length, afforded him 
time to examine his priſon: it was a 
ſquare room, which formed the ſummit 
of a tower built on the eaſt ſide of the 


caſtle, round which the bleak winds 


howled mournfully; the inſide of the 
'©:6 apart- 


(36 ) 


apartment was old and falling to decay: 


a ſmall mattraſs, which lay in one cor- 


ner of the room, a broken matted chair, 
and a tottering table, compoſed its fur- 


niture; two ſmall and ſtrongly grated 


windows, which admitted a ſufficient 
degree of light and air, afforded him on 
one ſide a view into an inner court, and 
on the other a dreary proſpect of the 
wild and barren Highlands: 


Alleyn was conveyed through dark 


and winding paſſages to a diſtant part 


of the caſtle, where at length a ſmall. 


door, barred with iron, opened, and 
diſcloſed to him an abode, whence light 
and hope were equally excluded. He 


ſhuddered as he entered, and the door 
was cloſed upon him. 


The mind of the Baron, in the mean 
time, was agitated with all the direful 
paſſions of hate, revenge, and cxulting 
pride, He racked imagination for the

invention of tortures equal to the force 
of his feelings; and he at length diſco. 
vered that the ſufferings of ſuſpenſe are 
ſuperior to thoſe of the moſt terrible 
evils, when once aſcertained, of which 
the contemplation gradually affords to 
ſtrong minds the means of endurance. 
He determined, therefore, that the Earl 
ſhould remain confined in the tower, 


ignorant of his future deſtiny ; and in 


the mean while ſhould be allowed food 
only ſufficient to keep him ſenſible of 
his wretchedneſs. 


Oſbert was immerſed in thought, 
when he heard the door of his priſon 
unbarred, and the Baron Malcolm ſtood 
before him. The heart of Oſbert 
ſwelled high with indignation, and de- 
fiance flaſhed in his eyes. © I am come,” 
ſaid the inſulting victor, © to welcome 


the Earl of Athlin to my caſtle; and to 


ſhew that I can receive my friends with 
the hoſpitality they deſerve; but I am 
yet 


(# 
yet undetermined what kind of feſtival 
I ſhall beſtow on his arrival.“ 


« Weak tyrant.” returned Oſbert, 


his countenance impreſſed with the firm 
dignity of virtue, © to inſult the vanquiſh- 
ed, is congenial with the cruel] mean- 
neſs of the murderer; nor do J expect, 
that the man who ſlew the father, will 
ſpare the ſon; but know, that fon is 
nerved againſt your wrath, and welcomes 
all that your fears or your cruelty can 


impoſe.” 


% Raſh youth,” replied the Baron, 
« your words are air; they fade from 
ſenſe, and ſoon your boaſted ſtrength 
ſhall fink beneath my power. I go to 
meditate your deſtiny.” With theſe 
words he quitted the priſon, enraged at 
the unbending virtue of the Earl. 


The fight of the Baron, rouſed in the 


ſoul of Oſbert all thoſe oppoſite emo- 
tions 


E ) 


tions of furious indignation and tender 


pity, which the glowing image of his 


father could excite, and produced a 
moment of perfect miſery. The dread- 
ful energy of theſe ſenſations exaſpe- 
rated his brain almoſt to madneſs; the 
cool fortitude in which he had ſo lately 
gloried, diſappeared; and he was on the 
point of reſigning his virtue and his 
life, by means of a ſhort dagger, which 
he wore concealed under his veſt, when 
the ſoft notes of a lute ſurpriſed his 


attention. It was accompanied by a 


voice ſo enchantingly tender and me- 
lodious, that its ſounds fell on the heart 
of Oſbert in balmy comfort: it ſeemed 
ſent by Heaven to arreſt his fate:— 
the ſtorm of paſſion was huſhed with- 
in him, and he diſſolved in tears of 
pity and contrition. The mournful 
tenderneſs of the air, declared the per- 
ſon from whom it came to be a ſufferer ; 


and Oſbert ſuſpected it to proceed from 


a priſoner like himſelf. The muſic 
ceaſed; 


„  } 


ceaſed. Abſorbed in wonder, he went to 
the grates in queſt of the ſweet muſi- 
Elan, but no one was to be ſeen; and he 
was uncertain whether the ſounds 
aroſe from within or from without the 
caſtle. - Of the guard, who brought 
him his ſmall allowance of frod, he 
enquired concerning what he had heard ; 
but from him he could not obtain the 
information he ſought, and he was con- 
ſtrained to remain in a ſtate of ſuſ- 


penſe. 


In the mean time the caſtle of Ath- 
lin, and its neighbourhood, was over- 
whelmed with diſtreſs. The news of the 
Earl's impriſonment at length reached 
the ears of the Counteſs, and hope once 
more illumined her mind. She imme- 
diately ſent offers of immenſe ranſom 
to the Baron, for the reſtoration of her 
| ſon, and the other priſoners; but the 
ferocity of his nature diſdaine d an in- 
complete triumph. Revenge ſubdued 

his 


{47 

his avarice; and the offers were rejected 
with the ſpurn of contempt. An addi- 
tional motive, however, operated in his 
mind, and confirmed his purpoſe. The 
beauty of Mary had been often reported 
to him in terms which excited his curi- 
oſity; and an accidental view he once 
obtained of her, raiſed a paſſion in his 
foul, which the turbulence of his cha- 
racter would not ſuffer to be extin- 
guiſhed. Various were the ſchemes he 
had projected to obtain her, none of 
which had ever been executed; the 
poſſeſſion of the Earl, was a circum- 
ſtance the moſt favourable to his wiſhes, 
and he reſolved to obtain Mary, as the 
future ranſom of her brother. He con- 
cealed, for the preſent, his purpoſe, 
that the tortures of anxiety and deſpair 
might operate on the mind of the Coun- 
teſs, to grant him an eaſy conſent to the 
exchange, and to reſign the victim the 
wite of her enemy. 

The

The ſmall remains of the clan, un- 
ſubdued by misfortune, were eager to 
aſſemble; and, hazardous as was the 
enterprize, to attempt the reſcue of 
their Chief. The hope which this un- 
dertaking afforded, once more revived 
the Counteſs; but alas! a new ſource 
of ſorrow was now opened for her: the 
health of Mary viſibly declined; ſhe 
was ſilent and penſtve; her tender 
frame was too ſuſceptible of the ſuf- 
ferings of her mind; and theſe ſuffer- 
ings were heightened by concealment. 
She was preſcribed amuſement and gen- 
tle exerciſe, as the beſt reſtoratives of 
peace and health. One day, as ſhe was 
ſeeking on horſeback theſe loſt trea- 
ſures, ſhe was tempted by the fine- 
neſs of the evening to prolong her 
ride beyond its uſual limits: the ſun 
was declining when ſhe entered a wood, 
whoſe awful glooms ſo well accorded 
with the penſive tone of her mind. The 


ſoft ſerenity of evening, and the ſtill 
| ſolemnity 


6 


folemnity of the ſcene, conſpired to lull 
her mind into a pleaſing forgetfulneſs of 
its troubles; from which ſhe was, ere 


long, awakened by the approaching 


ſound of horſes* feet. The thickneſs of 
the foliage limited her view ; but look- 
ing onward, ſhe thought ſhe perceived 
through the trees, a glittering of arms ; 
ſhe turned her palfry, and ſought the 
entrance of the wood. The clattering 
of hoofs advanced in the breeze! her 
heart miſgave her, and ſhe quickened 
her pace. Her fears were ſoon juſtified ; 
ſhe looked back, and beheld three 
horſemen armed and diſguiſed ad- 
vancing with the ſpeed of purſuit. 
Almoſt fainting, ſhe flew on the wings 
of terror; all her efforts were vain; the 
villains came up; one ſeized her horſe, 
the others fell upon her two attendants: 
a ſtout ſcuffle enſued, but the ſtrength of 
her ſervants ſoon yielded to the weapons 
of their adverſaries; they were brought to 
the ground, dragged into the wood, and

there left bound to the trees. In the 
mean time, Mary, who had fainted in the 
arms of the villain who ſeized her, was 
borne away through the intricate mazes 
of the woods; and. her terrors may be 
eaſily imagined, when ſhe revived, and 
found herſelf in the hands of unknown 
men. Her dreadful ſcreams, her tears, 
her ſupplications, were ineffectual; the 
wretches were deaf alike to pity and to 
enquiry; they preſerved an inflexible 


ſilence, and ſhe ſaw herſelf conveying 


towards the mouth of a horrible cavern, 
when deſpair ſeized her mind, and ſhe 
loft all figns of exiſtence: in this ſtate 
ſhe remained ſome time; but it is im- 
poſſible to deſcribe her ſituation, when 
ſhe uncloſed her eyes, and beheld Alleyn, 
who was watching with the moſt trem- 
bling anxiety her return to life, and 
whoſe eyes, on ſeeing her revive, ſwam 
in joy and tenderneſs. Wonder, fear- 
ful joy, and the various ſhades of 
mingled emotions, paſled in quick ſuc-

ceſſion over her countenance ; her ſur- 
prize was increaſed; when ſhe obſerved 
her own ſervants ſtanding by, and could 
diſcover no one but friends. She 
ſcarcely dared to truſt her ſenſes, but 
the voice of Alleyn, tremulous with ten- 
derneſs, diſſolved in a moment the 
illuſions of fear, and confirmed her in 
the ſurpriſing reality. When ſhe was 
ſufficiently recovered, they quitted this 
ſcene of gloom; they travelled on in a 
ſlow pace, and the ſhades of night were 
fallen long before they reached the 
caſtle; there diſtreſs and confuſion ap- 
peared. The Counteſs, alarmed with 
the moſt dreadful apprehenſions, had 
diſpatched her ſervants various ways in 
ſearch of her child, and her tranſports 
on again beholding her in ſafety, pre- 
vented her obſerving immediately that 
it was Alleyn who accompanied her. 


Joy, however, ſoon yielded to its equal 


wonder, when ſhe perceived him, and 


in the tumult of contending emotions,

the ſcarce knew which firſt to interro- 
gate. When ſhe had been told the 
eſcape of her daughter, and by whom 
effected, ſhe prepared to hear, with im- 
patient ſolicitude, news of her beloved 
fon, and the means by which the brave 


young Highlander had eluded the vigi- 
lance of the Baron. Of the Earl, Al- 
leyn could only inform the Counteſs, 
that he was taken priſoner with himſelf, 
within the walls of the fortreſs, as they 
fought ſide by ide; that he was con- 
ducted, unwounded, to a tower ſituated 
on the eaſt angle of the caſtle, where he 
was ſtill confined. Himſelf had been 
impriſoned in a diſtant part of the pile, 
and had been able to collect no other 
particulars of the Earl's ſituation, than 
thoſe he had related. Of himſelf he 
gave a brief relation of the following 


circumſtances : + 


After having lain ſome weeks in the 


horrible dungeon allotted him, his 
mind 


( 47 )- 


mind involved in the gloom of deſpair, 
and filled with the momentary expecta- 
tion of death, defperation furniſhed him 
with invention, and he concerted the 
following plan of eſcape :—He had ob- 
ſerved, that the guard who brought 
him his allowance of food, on quitting 
the dungeon, conſtantly . ſounded his 
ſpear againſt the pavement near the en- 
trance. This circumſtance excited his 
ſurprize and curioſity. A ray of hope 
beamed through the gloom of his dun- 
geon. He examined the ſpot, as well 
as the obſcurity of the place would per- 
mit; it was paved with flag ſtones like 
the other parts of the cell, and the 
paving was every where equally firm, 
He, however, became certain, that ſome 
means of eſcape was concealed beneath 
that part, for the guard was conſtant in 
examining it by ſtriking that ſpot, and 
treading more firmly on it; and this he 
endeavoured to do vithout being ob- 
ſerved. One day, immediately after 
the 


"0-0 3 
the departure of the guard, Alleyn ſet 
himſelf to unfaſten the pavement ; this, 
with much patience and induſtry, he 
effected, by means of a ſmall knife which 
had eſcaped the ſearch of the ſoldiers. 
He found the earth beneath hard, and 
without any ſymptoms of being lately 
diſturbed ; but after digging a few feet, 
he arrived at a trap door; he trembled 
with eagerneſs. It was now almoſt night, 
and he was overcome with wearineſs; 
he doubted whether he ſhould be able 
to penetrate through the door, and 
what other obſtructions were behind it, 
before the next day. He therefore, 
threw the earth again into the hole, and 
endeavoured to cloſe the pavement ; 
with much difficulty, he trod the earth 
into the opening, but the pavement he 
was unable exactly to replace. It was 
too dark to examine the ſtones.; and he 
found, that even if he ſhould be able to 
make them fit, the pavement could not 


be made firm. His mind and body 
5 were 


( 49 3} 
were now overcome, and he threw him- 


ſelf on the ground in an agony of de- 
ſpair. It was midnight, when the re- 


turn of his ſtrength and ſpirits produced 


another effort. He tore the earth up 


with haſty violence, cut round the lock 
of the trap door, and raiſing it, unwil- 
ling to heſitate or conſider, ſprung 
through the aperture. The vault was 
of conſiderable depth, and he was 


thrown down by the violence of the 


fall: an hollow echo, which ſeemed to 
murmur at a diſtance, convinced him 
that the place was of conſiderable ex- 
tent. He had no light to direct him, 


and was therefore obliged to walk with . 


his arms extended, in ſilent and fearful 
examination. After having wandered 
through the void a conſiderable time, he 
came to a wall, along which he groped 
with anxious care; it conducted hin 
onward for a length of way: it turned; 
he followed, and his hand touched the 
cold iron work of a barred window.

He felt the gentle undulation of the air 
upon his face; and to him, who had been 
ſo long confined among the damp va- 
pours of a dungeon, this was a moment 
of luxury. The air gave him ſtrength; 

and the means of eſcape, which now 
ſeemed preſented to him, renewed his 
courage. He ſet his foot againſt the 
wall, and graſping a bar with his hand, 
found it gradually yield to his ſtrength, 
and by ſucceſſive efforts, he entirely diſ- 
placed it. He attempted another, but 
it was more firmly fixed, and every 
effort to looſen it was ineffectual; he 
found that it was faſtened in a large 
ſtone of the wall, and that to remove 
this ſtone, was his only means of diſ- 
placing the bar ; he ſet himſelf, there- 
fore, again to work with his knife, and 
with much patience, looſened the mor- 
tar ſufficiently to effect his purpoſe. 
After ſome hours, for the darkneſs made 
his labour tedious, and ſometimes inef- 


fectual, he had removed ſeveral of the 
bars, 


( $8 2 
bars, and had made an opening almoſt 
ſufficient to permit his eſcape, when the 
dawn of light appeared; he now diſ- 
covered, with inexpreſſible anguiſh, that 
the grate opened into an inner court of 
the caſtle, and even while he heſitated, 
he could perceive ſoldiers deſcending 
ſlowly into the court, from the narrow 
ſtaircaſes which led to their apartments. 
His heart ſickened at the ſight. He 
reſted againſt the wall in a "pan of 
deſpair, and was on the point of ſpring- 
ing into the court, to make a deſperate 
effort at eſcape, or die in the attempt, 
when he perceived, by the encreaſing 
light which fell acroſs the vault, a maſly 
door in the oppoſite wall; he ran to- 
wards it, and endeavoured to open it; it 
was faſtened by a lock and ſeveral bolts, 
He ftruck againſt it with his foot, and 
the hollow found which was returned, 
convinced him that there were vaults 


beyond ; and by the direction of theſc 
D 2 vaults, 


3 
vaults, he was certain that they muſt 
extend to the outer walls of the caſtle; 
if he could gain theſe vaults, and pene- 


trate beyond them in the darkneſs of 


the enſuing night, it would be eaſy to 


leap the wall, and croſs the ditch; but 


it was impoſſible to cut away the lock, 
before the return of his guard, who re- 
gularly viſited the cell ſoon after the 
dawn of day. After ſome conſideration, 
therefore, he determined to ſecrete him- 
ſelf in a dark part of the vault, and 
there await the entrance of the guard, 
who on obſerving the deranged bars of 
the grate, would conclude, that he had 
eſcaped through the aperture. He had 
ſcarcely placed himſelf according to his 
plan, when he heard the door of the 
dungeon unbolted; this was inſtantly 
followed by a loud voice, which ſounded 
down the opening, and “ Alleyn” was 
ſhouted in a tone of fright and conſter- 
nation. After repeating the call, a man 
jumped into the vault. Alleyn, though 

himſelf 


30 4 
himſelf concealed in darkneſs, could 
perceive, by the faint light which fell 
upon the ſpot, a foldier with a drawn 
{word in his hand. He approached the 
grate with execrations, examined it» 
and proceeded to the door; it was faſt ; 
he returned to the -grate, and then pro- 
ceeded along the walls, tracing them 
with the point of his ſword. He at 
length approached the ſpot where Al- 
leyn was concealed, who felt the ſword 
{ſtrike upon his arm, and inſtantly graſp- 
Ing the hand which held it, the weapon 
fell to the ground. A ſhort ſcuffle en- 
ſued; Alleyn threw down his adverſary, 
and ſtanding over him, ſeized the ſword, 
and preſented it to his breaſt; the ſoldier 
called for mercy. Alleyn, always unwil. 
ling to take the life of another, and con- 
ſidering that if the ſoldier was ſlain, h's 
comrades would certainly follow to the 
vault, returned him his ſword. “ Take 
your life,“ ſaid he,“ your death can 
avail me nothing take it, and if you 


D 3 can, * 


TW 7 
can, go tell Malcolm, that an innocent 
man has endeavoured to.efcape deſtruc- 
tion.” The guard, ſtruck with his con- 
duct, aroſe from the ground in filence, 
de received his ſword, and followed Al- 
Jevn to the trap door. They returned 
into the dungeon, where Alleyn was 
once more left alone. The ſoldier, un- 
determined how to act, went to find his 
comrades; on the way he met Malcolm 
who, ever reſtleſs and vigilant, fre- 
quently walked the ramparts at an early 
hour. He enquired if all was well. 
The ſoldier, fearful of diſcovery, and 
unaccuſtomed te diſſemble, heſitated at 
the queſtion ; and the ſtern air aſſumed 
by Malcolm, compelled him to relate 
what had happened. The Baron, with 
much harſhneſs, reprobated his neglect, 
and immediately followed him to the 
dungeon, where he loaded Alleyn with 
inſult. He examined the cell, deſcended 
into the vault, and returning to the 
dungeon, ſtood by, while a chain, which 
| had 


qt 1 


had been fetched from a diſtant part of 
the caſtle, was fixed into the wall ;—to 
this Alleyn was faſtened. © We will 
not long confine you thus,” ſaid Mal- 
colm, as he quitted the cell, © a few 
days ſhall reſtore you to the liberty you 
are ſo fond of; but as a conqueror 
ought to have ſpectators of his triumph, 
you muſt wait till a number 1s collected 
ſufficient to witnels the death of ſo great 
an hero.” © I diſdain your inſults,” 
returned Alleyn, “and am equally able 
to ſupport misfortune, and to deſpiſe a 
tyrant.” Malcolm retired, enraged at 
the boldneſs of his priſoner, and uiter- 

ing menaces on the careleſſneſs of the 
guard, who vainly endeavoured to juſ- 
tify himſelf. «© His ſafety be upon 
your head,” ſaid the Baron. The ſoldier 
was ſhocked, and turned away in ſullen 
ſilence. Dread of his priſoner's effect- 
ing an eſcape, now ſeized his mind; 
the words of Malcolm filled him with 
reſentment, while gratitude towards

(: 90: 1 

Alleyn, for the life he had ſpared, ope- 
rated with theſe ſentiments, and he he- 
ſitated whether he ſhould obey the Ba- 
ron, or deliver Alleyn, and fly his op- 
preſſor. At noon, he carried him his 
cuſtomary food; Alleyn was not ſo loſt 
in miſery, but that he obſerved the 
gloom which hung upon his features ; 
his heart foreboded impending evil: 
the ſoldier bore on his tongue the ſen- 
tence of death. He told Alleyn, that 
the Baron had appointed the following 
day for his execution; and his people 
were ordered to attend. Death, how- 
ever long contemplated, muſt be dread- 
ful when it arrives; this was no more 
than what Alleyn had expected, and on 
what he had brought his mind to gaze 
without terror; but his fortitude now 
ſunk before its immediate preſence, and 
every nerve of his frame thrilled with 
agony, Be comforted,” ſaid the ſol- 
dier, in a tone of pity, © I, too, am no 
ſtranger to miſery; and if you are wil- 

ling 


0 7 

ling to riſque the danger of double 
torture, I will attempt to releaſe both 
you and myſelf from the hands of a 
tyrant.” At theſe words, Alleyn ſtarted 
from the ground in a tranſport of de- 
lightful wonder: © Tell me not of 
torture,” cried he, © all tortures are 
equal if death is the end, and from 
death I may now eſcape; lead me but 
beyond theſe walls, and the ſmall poſ- 
ſeſſions I have, ſhall be your's for ever.” 
« I want them not,” replied the gene- 
rous ſoldier, © it is enough for me, that 
I fave a fellow- creature from deſtruc- 
tion.” Theſe words overpowered the 
heart of Alleyn, and tears of gratitude 
ſwelled in his eyes. Edric told him, that 
the door he had ſeen in the vault below, 
opened. into a chain of vaults, which 
ſtretched beyond the wall of the caſtle, 
and communicated with a ſubterraneous 
way, anciently formed as a retreat from. 
the fortreſs, and which terminated in 
rae cavern of a foreſt at ſome diſtance. 

Ds If.

If this door could be opened, their 
efcape was almoſt certain. They con- 
ſulted on the meaſures neceſſary to be 
taken. The ſoldier gave Alleyn 2 
knife larger than the one he had, and 
directed him to cut round the lock, 
which was all that with-held their paſ- 
ſage. Edric's office of centinel was 
Propitious to their ſcheme, and it was 
agreed that at midnight they. ſhould 
deſcend the vaults. Edric, after hav- 
ing unfaſtened the chain, left the cell, 
and Alleyn ſet himſelf again to remove 


the pavement, which had been already 
re- placed by order of the Baron. The 


near proſpect of deliverance now glad- 
dened his ſpirits; his knife was better 
formed for his purpoſe; and he worked 
with alacrity and eaſe. He arrived at 
the trap door, and once more leaped into 
the vault. He applied himſelf to the 
lock of the door, which was extremely 
thick, and it was with difficulty he ſepa- 
rated them; with trembling hands he un- 

drew 


l 
drew the bolts, the door uncloſed, and diſ- 
covered to him the vaults. It was even- 
ing when he finiſhed his work. He 
was bur juſt returned to the dungeon, 
and had thrown himſelf on the ground 
to reſt, when the ſound of a diſtant ſtep 
caught his ear; he liſtened to its ad- 
vance with trembling eagerneſs. At 
length the door was unbolted; Alleyn, 
breathleſs with expectation, ſtarted up, 
and beheld not his ſoldier, but another; 
the opening was again diſcovered, and 
all was now over. The ſoldier brought 
a pitcher of water, and caſting round 
the place a look of ſullen ſcrutiny, de- 
parted in ſilence. The ſtretch of human 
endurance was now exceeded, and Al- 
leyn ſunk down in a ftate of torpidity. 
On recovering, he found himſelf again 
enveloped in the horrors of darkneſs, 
ſilence, and deſpair. Yet amid all his 
ſufferings, he diſdained to doubt the in- 
tegrity of his ſoldier: we naturally re- 


coil from painful ſenſations, and it is 
D 6 one 


({ $0 7) 


one of the moſt exquiſite tortures of a 
noble mind, to doubt the ſincerity of 
thoſe in whom it has confided. Alleyn 
concluded, that the converſation of the 
morning had been overheard, and that 
this guard had been ſent to examine the 
cell, and to watch his movements. He 
believed that Edric was now, by his 
own generoſity, involved in deſtruction; 
and in the energy of this thought, he 
forgot for a moment his own ſituation. . 


Midnight came, but Edric did not 
appear; his doubts were now con- 
firmed into certainty, and he reſigned 


himſelf to the horrid tranquillity of 


mute deſpair. He heard, from a diſ- 
trance, the clock of the caſtle ſtrike one; 
it ſeemed to ſound the knell of death; 
it rouſed his benumbed ſenſes, and he 
roſe from the ground in an agony of 
acuteſt recollecton. Suddenly he heard 


the ſteps of two perſons advancing 


down the avenue; he ſtarted, and liſ- 
tened.

tened. Malcolm and murder aroſe to 
his mind; he doubted not that the 
ſoldier had reported what he had ſeen in 
the evening, and that the perſons whom 
he now heard, were coming to execute 
the final orders of the Baron. They 
now drew near the dungeon, when ſud- 
denly he remembered the door in the 
vault. His ſenſes had been ſo ſtunned 
by the appearance of the ſtranger, and 
his mind ſo occupied with a feeling of 
deſpair, as to exclude every idea of 
eſcape; and in the energy of his ſuffer- 


ings he had forgot this laſt reſource. It 


now flaſhed like lightning upon his 
mind ; he ſprung to the trap door, and 
his feet had ſcarcely touched the bot- 
tom of the vault, when he heard the 
bolts of the dungeon undraw; he had 
juſt reached the entrance of the inner 
vault, when a voice ſounded from above, 
He pauſed, and knew it to be Edric's. 
Apprehenſion ſo entirely poſſeſſed his 
mind, that he heſitated whether he

ſhould diſcover himſelf; but a moment 
of recollection diſſipated every ignoble 
ſuſpicion of Edric's fidelity, and he an- 
ſwered the call. Immediately Edric 
deſcended, followed by the ſoldier 
whoſe former appearance had filled Al- 
leyn with deſpair, and whom Edric 
now introduced as his faithful friend 
and comrade, who, like himſelf, was 
weary of the oppreſſion of Malcolm, 
and who had reſolved to fly with them, 
and eſcape his rigour. This was a mo- 
ment of happineſs too great for thought! 
Alleyn, in the confuſion of his joy, 
and in his impatience to ſeize the mo- 
ment of deliverance, ſcarcely heard the 
words of Edric. Edric having returned 
to faſten the door of the dungeon, to 
delay purſuit, and given Alleyn a ſword 
which he had brought for him, led the 
way through the vaults. The profound 
{ilence of the place was. interrupted 
only by the echoes of their footſteps, 


which running through the dreary 
| chaſms 


( ag } 


chaſms in confuſed whiſperings, filled 


their imaginations with terror. In tra- 
verſing theſe gloomy and deſolate re- 
ceſſes they often pauſed to liſten, and 
often did their fears give them the diſ- 
tant ſounds of purſuit. On quitting 
the vaults, they entered an avenue, 
winding, and of conſiderable length, 
from whence branched ſeveral paſſages 
into the rock. It was cloſed by a low 
and narrow door, which opened upon a 
flight of ſteps, that led to the ſubterra- 
neous way under the ditch of the caſtle. 
Edric knew the intricacies of the place: 
they entered, and cloſing the door began 
to deſcend, when the lamp which 


Edric carried in his hand was blown 


out by the current of the wind, and 
they were left in total darkneſs. Their 
feelings may be more eaſily imagined 
than deſcribed; they had, however, no 
way but to proceed, and. grope with 
cautious ſteps the dark abyſs. Having 
continued to deſcend for ſome time, 

their 


( 64 ) 

their feet reached the bottom, and they 
found themſelves once more on even 
ground; but Edric knew they had yet 
another flight to encounter, before they 
could gain the ſubterraneous paſſage 
under the foſſe, and for which it re- 
quired their utmoſt caution to ſearch. 
They were proceeding with ſlow and 
wary ſteps, when the foot of Alleyn 
ſtumbled upon ſomething which clat- 
tered like broken armour, and endea- 
vouring to throw it from him, he felt 
the weight reſiſt his effort: he ſtooped 
to diſcover what it was, and found in 
his graſp the cold hand of a dead per- 
fon. Every nerve thrilled with horror 

at the touch, and he ſtarted back in an 
agony of terror. They remained for- 
ſome time in ſilent diſmay, unable to 
return, yet fearful to proceed, when a 
faint light which ſeemed to iſſue from 
the bottom of the laſt deſcent, gleamed 
upon the walls, and diſcovered to them. 


the ſecond ſtaircaſe, and at their feet 
the. 


(i 0 


the pale and disfigured corpſe of a man 
in armour, while at a diſtance they 
could diſtinguiſh the figures of men. 
At this ſight their hearts died within 
them, and they gave themſelves up for 
loſt. They doubted not but the men 
whom they ſaw were the murderers ; 
that they belonged to the Baron; and 
were in ſearch of ſome fugitives from 
the caſtle. Their only chance of con- 
cealment was to remain where they 
were; but the light appeared to ad- 


vance, and the faces of the men to turn 


towards them. Winged with terror, 
they ſought the firſt aſcent, and flying 
up the ſteps, reached the door, which 
they endeavoured to open, that they 
might hide themſelves from purſuit 


among the intricacies of the rock; their 


efforts, however, were vain, for the 


door was faſtened by a ſpring lock, and 


the key was on the other ſide. Com- 
pelled to give breath to their fears, they 


ventured to look back, and found them-

| ſelves again in total darkneſs; they 


pauſed upon the ſteps, and liſtening, all 
was ſilent. They reſted here a conſi- 
derable time; no footſteps ſtartled 
them; no ray of light darted through 
the gloom ; every thing ſeemed huſhed 
in the ſilence of death: they reſolved 
once more to venture forward; they 
gained again the bottom of the firſt de- 


ſcent, and ſhuddering as they ap- 
proached the ſpot where they knew the 


corpſe was laid, they groped to avoid 
its horrid touch, when ſuddenly the 
light again appeared, and in the ſame 
place where they had firſt ſeen it. They 
ſtood petrified with deſpair. The light, 
however, moved ſlowly onward, and 


_ diſappeared in the windings of the ave- 


nue. After remaining a long time in 
ſilent ſuſpenſe, and finding no further 
obſtacle, they ventured to proceed. The 


light had diſcovered to them their ſitu- 
ation, and the ſtaircaſe, and they now 


moved with greater certainty. They 
reached

reached the bottom in ſafety, and with- 
out any fearful interruption ; they liſ- 
tened, and again the ſilence of the 
place was undiſturbed. Edric knew 
they were now under the foſſe, their 


way was plain befure them, and their. 


hopes were renewed in the belief, that 
the light and the people they had ſeen, 
had taken a different direction, Ed- 
ric knowing there were various paſ- 
ſages branching from the main avenue 


which led to different openings in the 
rock. They now ftepped on with ala- 


crity, the proſpect of deliverance was 
near, for Edric judged they were now 
not far from the cavern. An abrupt 
turning in the paſſage confirmed at 
once this ſuppoſition, and extinguiſhed 
the hope which had attended it ; for the 
light of a lamp burſt ſuddenly upon 
them, and exhibited to their ſickening 
eyes, the figures of four men in an atti- 
tude of menace, with their ſwords 
pointed ready to receive them. Alleyn 

drew 


% 


{ * 7 


drew his ſword, and advanced, © We will 
die hardly,” cried he. At the ſound 
of his voice, the weapons inſtantly 
dropped from the hands of his adverſa- 
ries, and they advanced to meet him in 
a tranſport of joy. Alleyn recognized 
with aſtoniſhment, in the faces of the 
three ſtrangers, his faithful friends and 
followers; and Edric in that of the 
fourth, a fellow ſoldier. The ſame pur- 
poſe had aſſembled them all in the 
ſame ſpot. They quitted the cave to- 
gether; and Alleyn, in the joyful expe- 
rience of unexpected deliverance, re- 
ſolved never more to admit deſpair. 
They concluded, that the body which 
they had paſſed in the avenue, was that 
of ſome perſon who had periſhed either 
by hunger or by the ſword in thoſe ſub- ; 
terranean labyrinths. 


They marched in company till they 
came within a few miles of the caſtle of 
Athlin, when Alleyn made known his

deſign of collecting his friends, and 


joining the clan in an attempt to re- 
leaſe the Earl; Edric, and the other 
ſoldier, having ſolemnly enliſted in the 
cauſe, they parted; Alleyn and Edric 
purſuing the road to the caſtle, and the 3 
others ſtriking off to a different part of 1 
the country. Alleyn and Edric had not bt 
proceeded far, when the groans of the bl 
wounded ſervants of Matilda drew them Fg 
to the wood, in which the preceding 
dreadful ſcene had been acted. The i 
ſurprize of Alleyn was extreme, when 1 
he diſcovered the ſervants of the Earl il 
in this ſituation; but ſurprize ſoon i 
yielded to a more poignant ſenfation, * 
when he heard that Mary had been car- ll 
ried off by armed men. He ſcarcely | 
waited to releaſe the ſervants, but ſeiz&lt; 
ing one of their horſes which was graz- 
ing near, inſtantly mounted, ordering 
the reſt to follow, and took the way 
which had been pointed as the courſe of 
the raviſhers. Fortunately it was the 
| right

right direction; and Alleyn and the 
ſoldier came up with them as they were 
haſtening to the mouth of that cavern, 
whoſe frightful aſpect had chilled the 
heart of Mary with a temporary death. 
Their endeavours to fly were vain; they 
were overtaken at the entrance; a ſharp 
conflict enſued in which one of the 
ruffians was wounded and fled: his com- 
rades ſeeing the ſervants of the Earl ap- 
proaching, relinquiſhed their prize, and 
eſcaped through the receſſes of the cave. 
The eyes of Alleyn were now fixed in 
horror on the lifeleſs form of Mary, 
who had remained inſenſible during the 
whole of the affray; he was exerting 
every effort for her recovery, when ſhe 
uncloſed her eyes, and joy once more 


illumined his ſoul. 


During the recitital of theſe particu- 
lars, which Alleyn delivered with a mo- 
deſt brevity, the mind of Mary had ſuf- 


fered a variety of emotions ſympathetic 
to 


E 
to all the viciſſitudes of his ſituation. 


She endeavoured to conceal from herſelf 
the particular intereſt ſhe felt in his ad- 


ventures ; but ſo unequal were her ef. 
forts to the ſtrength of her emotions, 
that when Alleyn related the ſcene of 


Dunbayne cavern, her cheek grew pale, 
and ſhe relapſed into a fainting fit. 
This circumſtance alarmed the penetra- 
tion of the Counteſs; but the known 
weakneſs of her daughter's frame ap- 
peared a probable cauſe of the diſorder, 
and repreſſed her firſt apprehenſion. It 
gave to Alleyn a mixed delight of hope 
and fear, ſuch as he had never known 
before; for the firſt time he dared to 
acknowledge to his own heart that he 
loved, and that heart for the firſt time 


thrilled with the hope of being loved 
again. 


He received from the Counteſs the 


warm overflowings of a heart grateful 


ſor the preſervation of her child, and 
from 


&gt; 


( 72 ) 


from Mary a bluſh which ſpoke more 
than her tongue could utter. But the 
minds of all were involved in the ut- 
moſt perplexity concerning the rank 
and the identity of the author of the 
plan, nor could they diſcover any clue 
which would led them through this in- 
tricate maze of wonder, to the villain 
who had fabricated ſo diabolical a 
ſcheme. Their. ſuſpicions, at length, 
refted upon the Baron Malcolm, and 
this ſuppoſition was confirmed by the 
appearance of the horſemen, who evi- 
dently acted only as the agents of ſupe- 
rior power. Their conjectures were 
indeed juſt. Malcolm was the author 
of the ſcheme. It had been planned, 
and he had given orders to his people to 
execute it long before the Earl fell into 
his hands. They had, however, found 
no opportunity of accompliſhing the 
deſign when the caſtle was ſurprized, 
and in the conſequent tumult of his 
mind, 


1 


mind, the Baron had 128 to n 
dray his orders. 


Alleyn expreſſed his deſign of col- 
lecting the ſmall remnant of his friends, 
and uniting with the clan in attempting 
the reſcue of the Earl. © Noble youth,” 
exclaimed the Counteſs, unable longer 
to repreſs her admiration, © how can I 
ever repay your generous ſervices! Am 
I then to receive both my children at 
your hands? Go—my clan are now col- 
lecting for a ſecond attempt upon the 
walls of Dunbayne,—go! lead them to 
conqueſt, and reſtore to me my ſon.” 
The languid eyes of Mary re-kindled 
at theſe words, ſhe glowed with the 
hope of claſping once more to her bo- 
ſom her long loſt brother; but the ſuf- 
fuſions of hope were ſoon chaced by the 
chilly touch of fear, for it was Alleyn 
who was to lead the enterprize, and it 
was Alleyn who might fall in the at- 
tempt. Theſe contrary emotions un-

veiled to her at once the ſtate of her 


. affections, and ſhe ſaw in the eye of 


fancy, the long train of inquietudes and 
forrows which were likely to enſue. 
She ſought to obliterate from her mind 
every remembrance of the paſt, and of 
the fatal knowledge which was now 
diſcloſed to her ; but ſhe ſought in vain, 
for the monitor in her breaſt conſtantly 
preſented to her mind the image of Al- 
leyn, adorned with thoſe brave and man- 
ly virtues which had ſo eminently diſ- 
tinguiſhed his condutt; the infignifi- 
cance of the peaſant was loſt in the no- 
bility of the character, and every effort 
at forgetfulneſs was baffled. 


Alleyn paſſed that night at the caſtle, 
and the next morning, after taking leave 
of the Counteſs and her daughter, to 
whom his eyes bade a reſpectful and 
mournful adieu, he departed with Edric 
for his father's cottage, impatient to 
acquaint the good old man with. his 

ſafety,

ſafety, and to rouſe to arms his ſlum- 
bering friends. The breath of love 
had now raiſed into flame thoſe 
ſparks of ambition which had ſo long 
been kindling in his breaſt; he was 
not only eager to avenge the cauſe of 
injured virtue, and to reſcue from mi- 
ſery and death, the ſon of the Chief 
whom he had been ever taught to reve- 
rence, but he panted to avenge -the 
inſult offered to his miſtreſs, and to 
atchieve ſome deed of valour worthy 
her admiration and her thanks. 


Alleyn found his father at break- 
faſt, with his niece at his ſide; his 
face was darkened with ſorrow, and 
he did not perceive Alleyn when he 
entered. The joy of the old man 
almoſt overcame him, when he be. 
held his ſon in ſafety, for he was the 
ſolace of his declining years; and Edric 
was welcomed with the heartineſs of 
an old friend.

CHAPTER IV. 


MEANWHILE the Earl remained 


a ſolitary priſoner in the tower; 
uncertain fate was yet ſuſpended over 


him; he had, however, a magnanimity 


_ his nature which baffled much of the 
cruel effort of the Baron. He had pre- 


pared his. mind by habitual contempla- 


tion for the .worſt, and although that 
Merl was death, he could now look to 


r it even with ſerenity. Thoſe violent 


| tranſports which had aſſailed” him on 
ſight of the Baron, were, ſince he was 
no longer ſubjeét to his preſence, re- 
duced within their proper limits; yet 
he anXiouſly avoided dwelling on the 
memory of his father, leſt thoſe dread- 
ful ſenſations ſhould threaten him with 
returning torture. Whenever he per- 
mitted himſelf to think of the ſufferings 
of the Counteſs and his ſiſter, his heart 

melted 


— ʒ— — ar 


6 


melted with a ſorrow that almoft un- 
nerved him; much he wiſhed to know 
ho they ſupported this trial, and much 
he wiſhed that he could convey to them 
intelligence of his ſtate. He endea- 
voured to abſtract his mind from his 
ſituation, and ſought to make himſelf 
artificial comforts even from the barren 
objects around him; his chief amuſe- 
ment was in obſerving the manners and 
cuſtoms of the birds of prey which 
lodged themſelves in the battlements of 
his tower, and the rapacity of their na- 
ture furniſhed him with too juſt a paral- 
lel to the habits of men. 


As he was one day ſtanding at the 
grate which looked upon the caſtle, 
obſerving the progreſs of thele birds, 
his ear caught the ſound of that ſweet 
lute whole notes had once ſaved him # 
from deſtruction ; it was accompanied i 
by the ſame melodious voice he had 1 
formerly heard, and which now ſung 

E 3 with 


( 8 9 


with impaſſioned tenderneſs the follow- 
ing air: 


When firſt the vernal morn oſ life 
Beam'd on my infant eye, 
Fond I ſurvey'd the ſmiling ſcene, 
Nor ſaw the tempeſt nigh, 


Hope's bright illuſions touch'd my ſoul, 
My young ideas led ; 

And Fancy's vivid tints combin'd, 
And fairy proſpects ſpread. 


My guileleſs heart expanded wide, 
With filial fondneſs fraught; 

Paternal love that heart ſupplied 
With all its fondneſs ſought. 


But O! the eruel quick reverſe ! 

Fate all I loved involv'd ; 
Pale Grief Hope's trembling rays diſpers'd, 
| And Fancy's dreams diflolv'd, 


Loſt in kiiepribe, Olbert ſtood for 
ſome time looking down upon an inner 
court, whence the ſounds ſeemed to 


ariſe; after a few minutes he obſerved 


a young 


( y 7 


a young lady enter from that ſide on 
which the tower aroſe, on her arm reſted 
an elder one, in whoſe face might be 
traced the lines of decaying beauty ; but 
it was viſible, from the melancholy 
which clouded her - features, that the 
finger of affliction had there anticipated 
the ravages of time. She was dreſſed 
in the habit of a widow, and the black 
veil which ſhaded her forehead, and 
gave a fine expreſſion to her counte- 
nance, devolved upon the ground in a 
length of train, and heightened the na- 
tural majeſty of her figure; ſhe moved 
with flow ſteps, and was ſupported by 
the young lady whoſe veil half diſcloſed 
a countenance where beauty was touched 
with ſorrow and inimitable expreſſion ; 
the elegance of her form, and the dig- 
nity ofher air, proclaimed her to be of 
diſtinguiſhed rank. On her arm was 
hung that lute, whoſe melody had juſt 
charmed the attention of the Earl, who 


was now fixed in wonder at what he 
| E 4 beheld, 


«3 
———ꝓ—ͤ— — —H„- — 


6680) 


beheld, that was equalled only by his 


admiration, They retired through a 
gate on the oppolite ſide of the court, 
and were ſeen no more. Oſbert fol- 
lowed them with his eyes, which for 
ſome time remained fixed upon the 


door through which they had diſap- 


peared, almoſt inſenſible of their de- 
parture. When he returned to himſelf, 
he diſcovered, as if for the firſt time, 
that he was in ſolitude. He conjectured 
that theſe ſtrangers were confined by 
the oppreſſive power of the Baron, and 
his eyes were ſuffuſed with tears of pity. 
When he conſidered that ſo much beau- 
ty and dignity were the unreſiſting vic- 
tims of a tyrant, his heart ſwelled high 
with indignation, his priſon became in- 
tolerable to him, and he longed to be- 
come at once the champion of virtue, 
and the deliverer of oppreſſed innocence. 
The character of Malcolm aroſe to his 
mind black with accumulated guilt, 


and aggravated the deteſtation with 
| which 


n 


which he had ever contemplated it; 


the hateful idea nerved his ſoul with a 
confidence of revenge. Of the guard, 
who entered, he enquired concerning 


the ſtrangers, but could obtain no poſi- 


tive information; he came to impart 
other news; to prepare the Earl for 
death; the morrow was appointed for his 
execution. He received the intelli- 
gence with the firm hardihood of indig- 
nant virtue, diſdaining to ſolicit, and 
diſdaining to repine; and his mind yet 
graſped the idea of revenge. He drove 
from his thoughts, with precipitation, 
the tender ideas of his mother and ſiſter ; 
remembrances which would ſubdue his 
fortitude without effecting any benefi- 
cial purpoſe. He was told of the eſcape 
of Alleyn; this intelligence gave him 
inexpreſſible pleaſure, and he knew this 
faithful youth would undertake toavenge 


his death. 


When the news of Alleyn's flight 


= had 


E Wa 3 


had reached the Baron, his ſoul was 
ſtung with rage, and he called for the 
guards of the dungeon; they were no 
where to be found; and after a long 
ſearch it was known that they were fled 
with their priſoner; the flight of the 
other captives was alſo diſcovered. This 
circumſtance exaſperated the paſſion of 
Malcolm to the utmoſt, and he gave 
orders that the life of the remaining 
centinel ſhould be ſorfeited for the 
treachery of his comrades, and his own 
negligence; when recollecting the Earl, 
whom in the heat of his reſentment he 
had forgot, his heart exulted in the op- 
portunity he afforded of complete re- 
venge; and in the fullneſs of joy with 
which he pronounced his ſentence, he 
retracted the condemnation of the trem- 
bling guard. The moment after he had 
diſpatched the meſſenger with his re- 
| ſolve to the Earl, his heart faultered 
from its purpoſe. Such is the alter- 
nate violence of evil paſſions, that they 

| never 


E 
never ſuffer their ſubjects to act with 
conſiſtency, but, torn by conflicting 
energies, the gratification of one pro- 
penſity is deſtruction to the enjoyment 
of another; and the moment in which 
they imagine happineſs in their graſp, 
is to them the moment of diſappoint- 
ment. Thus it was with the Baron; 
his ſoul ſeemed to attain its full enjoy- 
ment in the contemplation of revenge, 
till the idea of Mary inflamed his heart 
with an oppoſite paſſion; his wiſhes had 
caught new ardor from diſappoint- 
ment, for he had heard that Mary had 
been once in the power of his emiſſaries; 
and perhaps the pain which. recoils 


upon the mind. from every fruitleſs effort 


of wickedneſs, ſerved to encreaſe the 
energies of his deſires. He ſpurned 
the thought of relinquiſhing the purſuit, 
yet there appeared to be no method of 
obtaining its object, bur by ſacrificing 
his favourite paſſion; for he had little 
doubt of obtaining Mary, when it ſhould 
E 6 be 


( #4 


be known that he reſolved not to grant 
the life of the Earl upon any other ran- 
ſom. The balance of theſe paſſions 
hung in his mind in ſuch nice equili- 
brium, that it was for ſome time uncer- 
tain which would preponderate ; re- 
venge, at length, yielded to love; but 
he reſolved to preſerve the torture of 
expected death, by keeping the Earl 
ignorant of his reprieve till the laſt 
moment. A 


The Earl awaited death with the ſame 
ſtern fortitude with which he received 
its ſentence, and was led from the tower 
to the platform of the caſtle, filent and 
unmoved. He beheld the preparations 
for his execution, the inftruments of 
death, theguards arranged in files, with 
an undaunted mind. The glare of exter- 
nals had no longer power over his ima- 
gination. He beheld every object with 
indifference, but that on which his eye 
now reſted; it was on the murderer, 
who 


E WS 3 
who exhibited himſelf in all the pride 


of exulting conqueſt : he ſtarted at the 


fight, and his ſoul ſhrunk back upon 
itfelf. Diſdaining, however, to appear 
diſconcerted, he endeavoured to reſume 
his dignity, when the remembrance of 
his mother, overwhelmed with ſorrow, 
ruſhed upon his mind, and quite un- 
manned him; the tears ſtarted in his 
eyes, and he ſunk ſenſeleſs on the 
ground. 


On recovering, he found himſelf in 
his priſon, and he was informed that the 
Baron had granted him a reſpite. Mal- 
colm miſtaking the cauſe of diſorder in 
the Earl, thought he had ſtretched his 
ſufferings to their utmoſt limits; he 
there fore had ordered him to be re- con- 
veyed to the tower. | 


A ſcene ſo ſtriking and fo public as 
that which had juſt been performed at 
the caſtle of Dunbayne, was a ſubject of 

diſcourſe 


' 8 3 . 
diſcourſe to the whole country; it was 
ſoon reported to the Counteſs with a va- 
riety of additional circumſtances, among 
which it was affirmed, that the Earl had 
been really executed. Overwhelmed 
with this intelligence, Matilda relapſed 
into her former diſorder. Sickneſs had 
rendered Mary leſs able to ſupport the 
ſhock, and to apply that comfort to the 
afflictions of her mother, which had 
once been ſo ſucceſsfully adminiſtered. 
The phyſician pronounced the malady 
of the Counteſs to be ſeated in the 
mind, and beyond the reach of human 
{kill, when one day a letter was brought 
to her, the ſuperſcription of which 
was written in the hand of Oſbert; ſhe 
knew the characters, and burſting the 
ſeal, read that her ſon was yet alive, 
and did not deſpair of throwing himſelf 
once more at her feet. He requeſted 
that the remains of his clan might im- 
mediately attempt his releaſe. He de- 
ſcribed in what part of the caſtle his 

priſon 

4 


( of ) 

priſon was ſituated, and thought, that by 
the aſſiſtance of long ſcaling-ladders and 
ropes, contrived in the manner he di- 
rected, he might be able to effect his 
eſcape through the grate. This letter 
was a reviving cordial to the Counteſs 
and to Mary, 


Alleyn was indefatigable in collect- 
ing followers for the enterprize he had 
engaged in. On receiving intelligence 
of the ſafety of the Earl, he viſited the 
clan, and was ſtrenuous in exhorting 
them to immediate action. They re- 
quired little incitement to a cauſe in 
which every heart was ſo much inte- 
reſted, and for which every hand was 
already buſied in preparation. Theſe 
preparations were at length completed ; 
Alleyn, at the head of his party, joined 
the aſſembled clan. The Counteſs for 
a ſecond time beheld from the ramparts 
the departure of her people upon the 
ſame hazardous enterprize; the preſent 
ſcene 


( 88 ) 
ſcene revived in her mind a ſad remem- 
brance of the paſt; the ſame tender 
fears, and the ſame prayers for ſucceſs 
ſhe now gave to their departure; and 
when they faded in diſtance from her 
fight, ſhe returned into the caſtle diſ- 
ſolved in tears. The heart of Mary 
was torn by a complex ſorrow, and 
incapable of longer concealing from 
herſelf the intereſt ſhe took in the de- 
parture of Alleyn, her agitation became 
more apparent. The Counteſs in vain 
endeavoured to compole her mind, 
Mary, affected by her tender concern, 
and prompted by the natural ingenu- 
ouſneſs of her diſpoſition, longed to 
make her the confidant of her weakneſs, 
if weakneſs that can be termed which 
ariſes from gratitude, and from the ad- 
miration of great and generous qualities; 
but delicacy and timidity arreſted the 
half-formed ſentence, and cloſed her 
lips in filence. Her health gradually 


declined under the ſecret agitation of 
her 


ET 
her mind; her phyſician knew her diſ- 
order to originate in ſuppreſſed ſorrow, 
and adviſed, as the beſt cordial, a confi- 
dential friend. Matilda now perceived 
the cauſe of her grief; her former 
paſling obſervations recurred to her me- 
mory, and juſtified her diſcernment. 
She ſtrove by every ſoothing effort to win 
her to her confidence. Mary, oppreſſed 
by the idea of ungenerous concealment» 
reſolved at length to unveil her heart 
to a mother ſo tender of her happineſs. 
She told her all her fentiments. The 
Counteſs ſuffered a diſtreſs almoſt equal 
to that of her daughter; her affectionate 
heart ſwelled with equal wiſhes for her 
happineſs; ſhe admired with warmeſt 
gratitude the noble and aſpiring vir- 
tues of the young Highlander ; but the 


proud nobility of her ſoul repelled with _ 
quick vivacity every idea of union 


with a youth of ſuch ignoble birth: the 
regarded the preſent attachment as the 
paſſing impreſſion of youthful fancy, 

| 2 "==

. 
and believed that gentle reaſoning, aided 
by time and endeavour, would conquer 
the enthuſiaſm of love. Mary liſtened 
with attention to the reaſonings of the 
Counteſs; her judgment acknowledged 
their juſtneſs, while her heart regretted 
their force. She reſolved, however, to 
overcome an attachment which would 
produce ſo much diſtreſs to her family 
and to herſelf. Notwithſtanding her 
endeavours to exclude Alleyn from her 
thoughts, the generous and heroic qua- 
lities of his mind burſt upon her me- 
mory in all their ſplender, ſhe could 
not but be conſcious that he loved her; 
ſhe ſaw the ſtruggles of his ſoul, and 
the delicacy of his paſſion, which made 
him ever retire in the moſt profound 
and reſpectful ſilence from its objedt. 
She ſolicited her mother to aſſiſt in ex- 
pelling the deſtructive image trom her 
mind. The Counteſs exerted every ef- 
fort to amuſe her to forget fulneſs; every 
hour, except thoſe which were given to 
exerciſes 


( 7 
exerciſes neceſlary. for her health, was 
devoted to the cultivation of her mind, 
and the improvement of her various 
accompliſhments. Theſe endeavours 
were not unſucceſsful; the Countefs 
with joy obſerved the returning health 
and tranquillity of her daughter; and 


Mary almoſt believed ſhe had taught 


herſelf to forget. Theſe engagements 
ſerved alſo to beguile the tedious mo- 
ments which muſt intervene, ere news 
could arrive from Alleyn concerning 
the probable ſucceſs of the enterprize. 


Miſery yet dwelt in the caſtle of 
Dunbayne; for there the virtues were 


captive, while the vices reigned deſpo- 
tic. The mind of the Baron, ardent 


and reſtleſs, knew no peace: torn by 
conflicting paſſions, he was himſelf the 
victim of their power. 


The Earl knew that his life hung up- 
on the caprice of a tyrant; his mind 
Was 


( 8) 
was nerved for the worſt; yet the letter 
which the compaſſion of one of _his 
guards, at the riſque of his life, had un- 
dertaken to convey to the Counteſs, 
afforded him a faint hope that his people 
might yet effect his eſcape. In this 
expectation, he ſpent hour after hour 
at his grate, wiſhing, with trembling 
anxiety, to behold his clan advancing 
cover the diſtant hills. Theſe hills be- 
came at length, in a ſituation ſo barren 
of real comforts, a ſource of ideal plea- 
ſure to him. He was always at the grate, 
and often, in the fine evenings of ſummer, 
ſaw the ladies, whoſe appearance had ſo 
ſtrongly excited his admiration and pi- 
ty, walk on a terrace below the tower. 
One very fine evening, under the pleaſ- 
ing impreſſions of hope for himſelf, and 
compaſſion for them, his ſufferings for 
a time loſt their acutenefs. He longed 
to awaken their ſympathy, and make 
known to them that they had a fellow- 


priſoner, The parting ſun trembled 
on 


| (' 9 
on the tops of the mountains, and a 
ſofter thade fell upon the diſtant land- 
ſcape. The ſweet tranquillity of even- 
ing threw an air of tender melancholy 
over his mind: his ſorrows for a while 
were huſhed; and under the enthuſiaſm 
of the hour, he compoſed the following 
ſtanzas, which, having committed them 
to paper, he the next evening dropp'd 
upon the terrace. 

S NF. 
Hail! to the hallow'd hill, the circling lawn, 
The breezy upland, and the mountain ftream ! 


The laſt tall pine that earlieſt meets the dawn, 
And gliſtens lateſt to the weſtern gleam!

Your dew-hid beauties Fancy oft unveils; 

What time to ſhepherd's reed, or Poet's ſtrain, 
Sorrowing my heart its deſtin'd woe bewails,

*Tis Fancy wafts it !—aud how ſweet the ſound ! 
T hear it now the diſtant hills uplong ; 
While fairy echos from their dells around,

the paper was taken up by the ladies, 
who immediately retired into the caſtle. 


CHAPTER 


( i ? 


CHEFTESER 


NE morning early, the Earl diſ- 
cerned a martial band emerging 

from the verge of the horizon; his 
heart welcomed his hopes, which were 
ſoon confirmed into certainty, It was 
his faithful people, led on by Alleyn. 
It was their deſign to ſurround and attack 
the caſtle; and though their numbers 
gave them but little hopes of conqueſt, ' 
they yet believed that, in the tumult 
of the engagement, they might pro- 
cure the deliverance of the Earl. With 
this view they advanced to the walls. 
The centinels had deſcried them at diſ- 
tance; the alarm was given; the trum- 
pets ſounded, and the walls of the caſtle 
were filled with men. The Baron was 
preſent, and directed the preparations. 
The ſecret purpoſe of his foul was fixed. 
The clan ſurrounded the fofle, into 
which 


( 96 ) 

which they threw bundles of faggots, 
and gave the ſignal of attack. Scaling 
ladders were thrown up to the window 
of the tower. The Earl, invigorated 
with hope and joy, had by the force of 
his arm, almoſt wrenched from its faſ- 
tening, one of the iron bars of the grate; 
his foot was lifted to the ſtanchion, 
ready to aid him in eſcaping through 
the opening, when he was ſeized by the 
guards of the Baron, and conveyed pre- 
cipitately from the priſon. He was led, 
indignant and deſperate, to the lofty 
ramparts of the caſtle, from whence he 
beheld Alleyn and his clan, whoſe eager 
eyes were once more bleſſed with the 
fight of their Chief; they were bleſſed 
but for a moment; they beheld their 
Lord in chains, ſurrounded with guards, 
and with the inſtruments of death. Ani- 
_ mated, however, with a. laſt hope, they 
renewed the attack with redoubled fury, 
when the trumpets of the Baron ſounded 
a parley, and they ſuſpended their arms. 
| The

of 


(297 
The Baron appeared on the ramparts; 
Alleyn advanced to hear him. © The 
moment of attack,” cried the Baron, 
is the moment of death to your Chief. 
If you. wiſh to preſerve his life, deſiſt 
from the aſſault, and depart in peace; 


and bear this meſſage to the Counteſs, 


your miſtreſs:—the Baron Malcolm 
will accept no other ranſom for the life 
and the liberty of the Earl, than her 
beauteous daughter, whom he now ſues 
to become his wife. If ſhe accedes to 
theſe terms, the Earl is inſtantly libera- 
ted, —if ſhe refuſes, —he dies.” The 
emotions of the Earl, and of Alleyn, on 
hearing theſe words, were inexpreſſible. 


The Earl ſpurned, with haughty virtue, 


the baſe conceſſion. © Give me death,” 
cried he with loud impatience; © the 
houſe of Athlin ſhall not be diſhonoured 
by alliance with. a murderer: renew the 
attack, my brave people; ſince you can- 
not fave the life, revenge the death of 
vour Chief; he dies contented, ſince his 

F death 


1 
death preſerves his family from diſho- 
nour.” The guards inſtantly ſurrounded 


the Earl. 


Alleyn, whoſe heart, torn by con- 
tending emotions, was yet true to the 


| impulſe of honour, on obſerving this, 


inſtantly threw down his arms, refuling 
to obey the commands of the Earl; a 
hoſtage for whoſe life he demanded, 
while he haſtened to the caſtle of Athlin 
with the conditions of the Baron. The 
clan, following the example of Alleyn, 
reſted on their arms, while a few pre- 
| pared to depart with him on the em- 
baſſy. In vain were the remonſtrances 
and the commands of the Earl; his peo- 
ple loved him too well to obey them, 
and his heart was filled with anguiſh 
when he ſaw Alleyn depart from the 


walls. 


The ſituation of Alleyn was highly 


pitiable ; all the firm virtues of his ſoul

were called upon to ſupport it. He was 


commiſſioned on an embaſſy, the alter- 
nate conditions of which would bring 
miſery on the woman he adored, or death 
to the friend whom he loved. 


When the arrival of Alleyn was an- 
nounced to the Counteſs, impatient joy 
thrilled in her boſom; for ſhe had no 
doubt that he brought offers of accom- 
modation; and no ranſom was pre- 
ſented to her imagination, which ſhe 
would not willingly give for the reſto- 
ration of her ſon. At the ſound of Al- 
leyn's voice, thoſe tumults which had 
began to ſubſide in the heart of Mary, 


were again revived, and ſhe awoke to 


the mournful certainty of hopeleſs en- 


deavour. Yet ſhe could not repreſs a 


ſtrong emotion of joy on again behold- 
ing him. The ſoft bluſh of her cheek 
ſhewed the colours of her mind, while, 
in endeavouring to ſhade her feelings, 


| ſhe impelled them into ſtronger light. 


F 2 * 


( 160 ) 


The agitations of Alleyn almoſt ſub. 


dued his ſtrength, when he entered the 


preſence of the Counteſs; and his vi- 
ſage, on which was impreſſed deep diſ- 
treſs, and the paleneſs of fear, betrayed 
the inward workings of his ſoul. Ma- 
tilda was inſtantly ſeized with appre- 
henſion for the ſafety of her ſon, and 


in a tremulous voice, enquired his 


fate. Alleyn told her he was well, pro- 
ceeding with tender caution to acquaint 


her with the buſineſs of his embaſſy, 


and with the ſcene to which he had 
lately been witneſs. The ſentence of 


the Baron fell like the ſtroke of death 


upon the heart of Mary, who fainted at 
the words. Alleyn flew to ſupport her. 


In endeavouring to revive her daugh- 


ter, the Counteſs was diverted for a 
time from the anguiſh which this intel- 
ligence muſt naturally impart. It was 
long ere Mary returned to life, and ſhe 


returned only to a ſenſe of wretched- 


neſs. The critical fituation of Matilda 


Can 


1 
can ſcarcely be felt in its full extent. 
Torn by the conflict of oppoſite inte- 
reſts, her brain was the ſeat of tumult, 
and wild diſmav. Which ever way ſhe 
looked, deſtruction cloſed the view. The 
murderer of the huſband, now ſought 


to murder the happineſs of the daugh- 


ter. On the ſentence of the mother 


hung the final fate of the ſon. In re- 


jecting theſe terms, ſhe would give him 
inſtant death; in accepting them, her 
conduct would be repugnant to the 
feelings of indignant virtue, and to the 
tender injured memory of her mur- 
dered Lord. She would deſtroy for 
ever the peace of her daughter, and the 
honour of her houſe. To effect his de- 
liverance by force of arms was utterly 
impracticable, ſince the Baron had de- 
clared, that “ the moment of attack 
ſhould be the moment of death to the 
Earl.” Honour, humanity, parental 
tenderneſs, bade her fave her ſon; yet, 


by a ſtrange contrariety of intereſts, the 


F'3 ſame 


— — — 


n A 


( 28 } 


ſame virtues pleaded with a voice equal- 
ly powerful, for the reverſe of the ſen- 
tence. Hitherto hope had ſtill illu- 
mined her mind with a diſtant ray ; ſhe 
now found herſelf ſuddenly involved in 
the darkneſs of deſpair, whoſe glooms 


were interrupted only by the gleams of 


horror which aroſe from the altar, on 


which was to be ſacrificed one of her 


beloved children. Her mind ſhrunk 
from the idea of uniting her daughter 
to the murderer of her father. The 
ferocious character of Malcolm was 


alone ſufficient to blight for ever the 


happineſs of the woman whoſe fate 
ſhould be connected with his. To give 
to the murderer the child of the mur- 
dered was a thought too horrid to reſt 
upon. The. Counteſs rejected with 
force the Baron's offer of exchange, 
when the bleeding figure of her be- 
loved ſon, pale and convulſed in death, 
ſtarted on her imagination, and ſtretched 
her brain almoſt to frenzy.

Meanwhile Mary ſuffered a conflict 
equally dreadful. Nature had beſtowed 
on her a heart ſuſceptible of all the fine 
emotions of delicate paſſion; a heart 
which vibrated in uniſon with the 
ſweeteſt feelings of humanity ; a mind, 
quick in perceiving the niceſt lines of 
moral rectitude, and ſtrenuous in en- 
deavouring to act up to its perceptions. 


| Theſe gifts were unneceſſary to make 
her ſenſible of the wretchedneſs of her 


preſent ſituat ion; of which a common 
mind would have felt the miſery; they 
ſerved, however, to ſharpen the points 
of affliction, to encreaſe their force, and 
to diſcloſe, in ſtronger light, the various 
horfors of her ſituation. Fraternal love 
and pity called loudly upon her to reſign 
herſelf into the power of the man whom, 
from the earlieſt dawn of perception, 
ſhe had contemplated with trembling 
averſion and horror. The memory of 


her murdered parent, every feeling dear 


to virtue, the tremulous, but forceful

„ a 
voice of love awakened her heart, and 
each oppoſed, with wild impetuoſity, 
every other ſentiment. Her ſoul ſhrunk 
back with terror from the idea of union 
with the Baron. Could ſhe bear to re- 
ceive, in marriage, that hand which was 
ſtained with the blood of her father?— 
The polluted touch would freeze her 
heart in horror could ſhe bear to paſs 
her liſe with the man, who had for ever

gave her being? — With the man who 
would ſtand betore her eyes a perpetual 
monument of miſery to- herſelf, and of 
diſhonour to her family? whoſe chilling 
aſpect would repel every amiable and 
generous affection, and ſtrike them back 
upon her heart only to wound it? To 
cheriſh the love of the noble virtues, 
would be to cheriſh the remembrance of 
her dead father, and of her living lover. 
How wretched muſt be her ſituation, 
when to obliterate from her memory 
the image of virtue, could alone afford

her a chance of obtaining a horrid tran- 


quillity; virtue which is ſo dear to the 
human heart, that when her form for- 


ſakes us, we purſue her ſhadow. Where- 
ever in ſearch of comfort ſhe. directed 


her aching ſight, Miſery's haggard- 


countenance obtruded on her view. 


Here ſhe beheld herſelf entombed in the 
arms of the murderer ;—there, the ſpec- 
tacle of her beloved brother, encircled 
with chains, and awaiting the ſtroke of 
death, aroſe to her imagination; the 
ſcene was too affecting; fancy gave her 
the horrors of reality: The reflection, 
that through her he ſuffered, that ſhe 
yet might ſave him from deſtruction, 
broke with irrefiſtible force upon her 
mind, and inſtantly bore away every op- 
poling feeling. She reſolved, that ſince 


ſhe muſt be wretched, ſhe would be no- 


bly wretched; ſince miſery demanded 
one ſacrifice, ſhe would devote herſelt 
the victim. | . i 
Cel gf 4 | With

With theſe thoughts, ſhe entered the 
apartment of the Counteſs, whoſe con- 
currence was neceſſary to ratify her 


reſolves, and, having declared them, 


awaited in trembling expectation her 
deciſion. Matilda had ſuffered a diſtrac- 
tion of mind, which the nature of no 
former trial had occaſioned her. On 
the unfortunate death of a huſband ten- 


derly beloved, ſhe had ſuffered all the 
ſorrow which tenderneſs, and all the 


ſhock which the manner of his death 
could occaftin. The event, however, 
ſhocking as it was, did not hang upon 


circumſtances over which ſhe had an 


influence; it was decided by an higher 


power; —it was decided, and never could 
be recalled ; ſhe had there no dreadful 


choice of horrors, no evil ratified by her 


own voice, to taint with deadly recol- 
lections her declining days. This 
+ choice, though forced upon her by the 


power of a tyrant, ſhe would ſtill conſi- 
der as in part her own; and the thought 
that

that ſhe was compelled to doom to de- 
ſtruction one of her children, harrowed 
up her ſoul almoſt to frenzy. 


Her mind, at length exhauſted with 
exceſs of feeling, was now fallen into a 


ſtate of cold and ſilent deſpair; ſhe be- 


came inſenſible to the objects around her, 
almoſt to the ſenſe of her own ſufferings, 
and the voice, and the propoſal of her 


daughter, ſcarcely awakened her powers 


of perception. He fhall live,” ſaid 
Mary, in a voice broken and tender; 
« He ſhall live, I am ready to become 
the ſacrifice. Tears prevented her pro- 
ceeding. At the word “ live,” the 
Counteſs raiſed her eyes, and threw - 
round her a look of wildnefs, which ſet- 
tling on the features of Mary, ſoftened 
into an expreſſion of ineffable tender- 
neſs, ſhe waved her head, and turned to 
the window. A few tears bedewed her 
cheek ; they fell like the drops of Hea- 


ven upon the withered plant, reviving

and expanding its dying foliage; they 
were the firſt her eyes had known ſince 
the fatal news had reached her. Reco- 
vering herſelf a little, ſhe ſent for Al- 
leyn, who was ſtill in the caſtle. She 
wiſhed to eonſult with him, whether 
there was not yet a poſſibility of effect- 
ing the efcape of the Earl. In afflicti- 
ons of whatever degree, where death 
has not already fixed the events in cer- 
tainty, the mind ſhoots almoſt beyond 
the ſphere of poſſibility in ſearch of 
hope, and feldom relinquiſhes the fond 
illuſien, till the ſtroke of reality diſſolves 
the enchantment. Thus it was with 
Matilda; after the grief produced by 
the firſt ſtroke of this diſaſter was ſome- 
what abated, ſhe was iifclined to think 
that her ſituation might not prove ſo 
deſperate as ſhe imagined; and her 
heart was warmed by a remote hope, 
that there might yet be deviſed ſome 
method of procuring the eſcape of the 
Earl, Alleyn came; he came in the 

2 trembling 


{. 89 } 
trembling expectation of receiving the 
deciſion of the Counteſs, and in the in- 
tention of offering to engage in any en- 
terprize, however hazardous, for the 
enlargement of the Earl. He repelled, 
with inſtant force, every idea of Mary's 
becoming the wife of Malcolm; the 
thought was too full of agony to be en- 
dured, and he threw the ſenſation from 
his heart as a poiſon which would deſtroy 
the pulſe of life. To preſerve Mary 
from a mifery ſo exquiſite, and to ſave 
the life of the Earl, he was willing to 
encounter any hazard; to meet death 
itſelf as an evil which appeared leſs 
dreadful than either of the former. He 
came prepared with this reſolution, and 
it ſerved to ſupport that fortitude which 
affliction had diſturbed, though it could 
not ſubdue. When he came again to the 
Counteſs, his diſtreſs was heightened 
by the ſcene before him; he beheld her 
leaning on a ſofa, pale and ſilent; her 
unconſcious eyes were fixed on an op- 
poſite 


E 


polite window; her countenance was 
touched with a wildneſs expreſſive of 
the diſorder of her mind, and ſhe re- 
mained for ſome time inſenſible of his 
approach. Such is the fluctuation of a 
mind overcome by diſtreſs, that if for 
a moment a ray of hope chears its dark- 
neſs, it vaniſhes at the touch of recollec- 
tion. Mary was ſtanding near the Count- 
eſs, whoſe hand ſhe held to her boſom. 
Her preſent ſorrow had heightened the 
natural penſiveneſs of her countenance, 
and ſhaded her teatures with an intereſt- 
ing languor, more enchanting than the 
vivacity of blooming health; her eyes 
{ought to avoid Alleyn, as an object 
dangerous to the reſolution ſhe had 
formed. Matilda remained abſorbed in 
thought. Mary wiſhed to repeat the 
purpoſe of her ſoul, but her voice trem- 
bled, and the half-formed ſentence died 
away on her lips. Alleyn enquired the 

commands of the Counteſs. © I am 
ready,” ſaid Mary, at length, in a low 
| and 


C aq } 


and tremulous voice, © to give myſelf 
the victim to the Baron's revenge. —I 
will ſave my brother.” At theſe words, 
the heart of Alleyn grew cold. Mary, 
overcome by the effort which they had 
occaſioned her, ſcarcely finiſhed the ſen- 
tence; her nerves ſhook, a miſt fell 
over her eye, and ſhe ſunk on the ſofa 
by which ſhe had ſtood. Alleyn hung 
over the couch in ſilent agony, watching 
her return to life. By the aſſiſtance of 
thoſe about her, ſhe ſoon revived. Al- 
leyn, in the joy which he felt at her reco- 
very, forgot for a moment his ſituation, 
and preſſed with ardor her hand to his 
boſom. Mary, whole ſenſes were yet 
ſcarcely recollected, yielded unconſci- 
ouſly to the ſoftneſs of her heart, and 
betrayed its ſituation by a fmile ſo ten- 
der, as to thrill the breaſt of Alleyn with 
the ſweet certainty of being loved. Hi- 
therto his paſſion had been chilled by 
the deſpair which the vaſt ſuperiority 


of her birth occaſioned, and by the mo- 
deſty

deſty which forbade him to imagine TOM 
he had merit ſufficient to arreſt the eye 


of the accompliſhed Mary. Perhaps, 
too, the diffidence natural to genuine 
love, might contribute to deceive him. 
It was not till this moment, that he ex- 
perienced that certainty which awaken- 
ed in his heart a ſenſe of delight hither- 
to unknown to him. For a moment he 
forgot the diſtreſſes of the caſtle, and his 
own ſituation; every idea faded from 


his mind, but the one he had ſo lately 


acquired; and in that moment he 
feemed to taſte perfect felicity. Re- 
collection, however, with all its train 
of black dependancies ſoon returned, 
and plunged him in a miſery as poig- 
nant as the joy from which he was NOW 


precipitated. 


The Counteſs was now ſufficiently 
compoſed to enter on the ſubject neareſt 
her heart. Alleyn caught, with eager- 
neſs, her mention of attempting the 

| deliverance

deliverance of the Earl, for the poſſi-

deſign, and ſpoke with ſuch flattering 
probability of ſucceſs, that the ſpirits 
of Matilda began once more to revive ; 
yet ſhe trembled to encourage hopes 
which hung on ſuch perilous uncer- 
tainty. It was agreed, that Alleyn 
thould conſult with the moſt able and 
truſty of the clan, whom age or infir- 
mity had detained from battle, on the 
means moſt likely to enſure ſucceſs, 
and then proceed immediately on the 
expedition: having firſt delivered to 
the Baron a meſſage from the Counteſs, 
requiring time for deliberation upon a 
choice ſo important, and importing that 
an anſwer ſhould be returned at the expi- 
ration of a fortnight. 


Alleyn accordingly afſembled thoſe 
whom he judged moſt worthy of the 
council:

the Earl might poſſibly have been re- 
moved from the tower to ſome new 
place of confinement, which it would 
be neceſſary firſt to diſcover, that the

CHAPTER. VI. 


HE caſtle of Dunbayne was ſtill 

the ſcene of triumph, and of 
wretchedneſs. Malcolm, - exulting in 
his ſcheme, already beheld Mary at his 
feet, and the Earl retiring in an anguiſh 
more poignant than that of death. He 
was ſurprized that his invention had 
not before ſupplied him with this means 
of torture: for the firſt time he wel- 
comed love, as the inſtrument of his 


revenge ; and the charms of Mary were 


heightened to his imagination by the 
ardent colours of this paſſion. He was 
confirmed in his reſolves, never to re- 
linquiſh the Earl, but on the conditions 
he had offered ; and thus for ever would 
he preſerve the houſe of Athlin a monu- 
ment of his triumph. 


Oſbert, for greater ſecurity, was con- 


veyed from the tower into a more cen- 


trical 


( 816-4 


trical part of the caſtle, to an apartment 
ſpacious but gloomy, whoſe gothic win- 
dows partly excluding light, threw a 
folemnity around, which chilled the 
heart almoſt to horror. He heeded not 
this; his heart was occupied with hor- 
rors of its own. He was now involved 
in a miſery more intricate, and more 
dreadful, than his imagination had yet 
painted. To die, was to him, who had 
ſo long contemplated the near approach 
of death, a familiar and tranſient evil ; 
but to ſee, even in idea, his family in- 
vol ved in infamy, and in union with the 
murderer, was the ſtroke which pierced 
his heart to its center. He feared that 
the cruel tenderneſs of the mother 
would tempt Matilda to accept the 
offers of the Baron; and he ſcarcely 
doubted, that the noble Mary would 
reſign herſelf the price of his life. He 
would have written to the Counteſs to 
have forbidden her acceptance of the 
terms, and to have declared his fixed 

reſolution 


2. 


reſolution to die, but that he had no 
means of conveying to her a letter; the 
ſoldier who had ſo generouſly under- 
taken the conveyance of his former one, 
having ſoon after diſappeared from his 
ſtation: The manly fortitude which 
had ſupported him through his former 
trials, did not deſert him in this hour 
of darkneſs; habituated ſo long to ſtrug- 
gle with oppoſing feelings, he had ac- 
quired the art of managing them; his 
mind attained a confidence in its pow- 
ers; reſiſtance ſerved only to increaſe ' 
its ſtrength, and to confirm the magna- 
nimity of 1ts nature. 

Alleyn had now joined the clan, and 
was ardent in purſuit of the neceſſary 
intelligence, He learned that the Earl 
had been removed from the tower, but 
in what part of the caſtle he was now 
confined he could not, diſcover; on this 
point all was vague conjecture. That 
he was alive, was only judged from the 


policy 


1 


policy of the Baron, whoſe ardent paſ- 
ſion for Mary was now well under- 
ſtood. Alleyn employed every ſtrata- 


gem his invention could ſuggeſt, to diſ- 


cover the priſon of the Earl, but with- 
out ſucceſs: at length compelled to 
deliver to Malcolm, the meſſage of the 
Counteſs, he demanded, as a prelimi- 


nary, that the Earl ſhould be ſhewn to 


his people from the ramparts, that they 
might be certain he was ſtill alive. Al- 
leyn hoped that his appearance would 
lead to a diſcovery of the place of his 
impriſonment, purpoſing to obſerve nar- 
rowly the way by which he ſhould re- 
tire. . 


The Earl appeared in ſafety on the 


ramparts, amid the ſhouts and acclama- 


tions of his people; the Baron, frown- 
ing defiance, was ſeen at his fide. Al- 
leyn advanced to the walls, and deli- 
vered the meſſage of Matilda. Oſbert 


ſtarted at its purpoſe; he foreſaw that

deliberation portended compliance. 
ſtung with the thought, he ſwore aloud 
he never would ſurvive the infamy of 
the conceſſion; and addreſſing himſelf 
to Alleyn, commanded him inſtantly to 
return to the Counteſs, and bid her 


ſpurn the baſe compliance, as ſhe feared 


to ſacrifice both her children to the 
murderer of their father. At theſe words, 


a ſmile of haughty triumph marked the 
features of the Baron, and he turned 


from Oſbert in ſilent exultation. The 


Farl was led off by the guards. Alleyn 


endeavoured in vain to mark the way 
they took; the lofty walls ſoon concealed 
them from his view. 


Alleyn now experienced how ſtrenu- 
ouſly a vigorous mind protects its fa- 
vourite hope; wayward circumſtances 
may. ſhock, diſappointment may check 
it; but it riſes ſuperior to oppoſition, 
and traverſes the ſphere of poſſibility to 
accompliſh its purpoſe, Alleyn did not

yet deſpair, but he was perplexed in 
what manner to proceed, 


In his way from the ramparts, Oſbert 
was ſurprized by the appearance of two 
ladies at a window near which he 


paſſed : the agitation of his- mind did 


not prevent his recognizing them as the 
ſame he had obſerved from the grates of 
the tower, with ſuch lively admiration, 
and who had excited in his mind fo 
much pity and curioſity. In the midſt 


of his diſtreſs, his thoughts had often 


dwelt on the ſweet graces of the youn- 
ger, and he had ſighed to obtain the 
ſtory of her ſorrows; for the melan- 


choly which hung upon her features 


proclaimed her to be unfortunate. They 


now ſtood obſerving Oſbert as he paſſed, 


and their eyes expreſſed the pity which 
his fituation inſpired. He gazed car- 
neſtly and mournfully upon them, and 
when he entered his priſon, again en- 
quired concerning them, but the ſame 

4 inflexible 


| 5 
inflexible ſilence was preſerved on the 
ſubject. | 


As the Earl fat one day muſing in 
his priſon, his eyes unvoluntarily fixed 
upon a pannel in the oppoſite wainſcot ; 
—he obſerved that it was differently. 
formed from the reſt, and that its pro- 
jection was fomewhat greater; a hope 
{ſtarted into his mind, and he quitted his 
ſeat to examine it. He perceived that. 
ir was ſurrounded by a ſmall crack, and 
on puſhing it with his hands it ſhook. 
under them. Certain that it was ſome- 
thing more than a pannel, he exerted 
all his ſtrength againft it, but without 
producing any new effect. Having 
tried various means to move it without. 
ſucceſs, he gave up the experiment, and 
returned to his ſeat melancholy and dil- - 
appointed. Several days paſſed with- 
out any further notice being taken of 
the wainſcot; unwilling, however, to 


relinquiſh a laſt hope, he returned to

the examination, when, in endeavouring 
to remove the pannel, his foot acci- 
dentally hit againſt one corner, and it 
ſuddenly flew open. It had been con- 


trived that a ſpring which was concealed 


within, and which faſtened the partition, 


| ſhould receive its impulſe from the 
| preſſure of a certain part of the pannel, 


which was now touched by the foot of 
the Earl. His joy on the difcovery 
cannot be expreſſed. An apartment 
wide and forlorn, like that which formed 
his priſon, now lay before him; the 
windows, which were high and arched, 
were decorated with painted glaſs; the 
floor was paved with marble; and it 


ſeemed to be the deſerted remains of 


a place of worſhip. Oſbert traverſed, 
with heſitating ſteps, its dreary length, 
towards a pair of folding doors, large 
and of oak, which cloſed the apartment : 
theſe he opened ; a gallery, gloomy and 
vaſt, appeared beyond; the windows, 
which were in the ſame ſtyle of Gothic 

architecture 


(ny) 


architecture with the former, were 
ſhaded by thick ivy that almoſt ex- 
cluded the light. Oſbert ſtood at the 
entrance, uncertain whether to pro- 
ceed; he liſtened, but heard no foot- 
ſtep in his priſon, and determined to go 
on. The gallery terminated on the left 
in a large winding ſtair-caſe, old and 
apparently neglected, which led to a 
hall below; on the right was a door, 
low, and rather obſcure. Oſbert, ap- 
prehenſi ve of diſcovery, paſſed the ſtair- 
caſe, and opened the door, when a ſuite 
of noble apartments, magnificently fur- 
niſhed, was diſcloſed to his wondering 
eyes. He proceeded onward without 
perceiving any perſon, but having 
paſſed the ſecond room, heard the faint 
ſobs of a perſon weeping; he ſtood for 
2 moment, undetermined whether to 
proceed; but an irreſiſtible curioſity im- 
pelled him forward, and he entered an 
apartment, in which were ſeated the 
beautiful ſtrangers, whoſe appearance

had ſo much intereſted his feelings. 


The elder of the ladies was diſſolved in 
tears, and a caſket and ſome papers lay 
open on a table beſide her. The younger 
was ſo intent upon a drawing, which ſhe 
ſeemed to be finiſhing, as not to obſerve 
the entrance of the Earl. The elder 
lady, on perceiving him, aroſe in ſome 
confuſion, and the ſurprize in her eyes 
ſeemed to demand an explanation of fo 
unaccountable. a viſit. The Earl, ſur- 


priſed at what he beheld, ſtepped back 


with an intention of retiring ; but recol- 
lecting that the intruſion demanded an 
apology, he returned. The grace with 
which he excuſed himſelf, confirmed 
the impreſſion which his figure had al- 
ready made on the mind of Laura, 
which was the name of the younger 
lady; who on looking up, diſcovered a 
countenance in which dignity and ſweet- 
neſs were happily blended. She ap- 
peared to be about twenty, her perſon 
was of the middle ſtature, extremely 

delicate, 


6 

delicate, and very elegantly formed. 
The bloom of her youth was ſhaded by 
a ſoft and penſive melancholy, which 
communicated an expreſſiun to her fine 
blue eyes, extremely intereſting. Her 
features were partly concealed by the 
beautiful luxuriance of her auburn hair, 
which curling round her face, deſcended 
in treſſes on her boſom ; every feminine 
grace played around her; and the ſimple 
dignity of her air declared the purity and 
the nobility of her mind. On perceiving 
the Earl, a faint bluſh animated her 

cheek, and ſhe involuntarily quitted the 
| drawing upon which ſhe had been en- 


gaged ; 


If the 6 imperfect view he had 
caught of Laura had given an impreſ 
ſion to the heart of Oſbert, it now re- 
ceived a ſtronger character from the op- 
portunity afforded him of contemplat- 
ing her beauty. He concluded that 
the Baron, attracted by her charms, had 


ay entrapped 


( 


entrapped her into his power, and de- 
tained her in the caſtle an unwilling 
priſoner. In this conjecture he was 
confirmed by the mournful caſt of her 
countenance, and by the myſtery which 
appeared to ſurround her. Fired by 
this idea, he melted in compaſſion for 
her ſufferings; which compaſſion was 
tinctured and encreaſed by the paſſion 
which now glowed in his heart. At 
that moment he forgot the danger of his 
preſent ſituation; he forgot even that 
he was a priſoner; and awake only to 
the wiſh of alleviating her forrows, he 
rejected cold and uſeleſs delicacy, and 
reſolved, if poſſible, to learn the cauſe 
of her misfortunes. Addreſſing himſelf 
to the Baroneſs, if, Madam,” ſaid he, 
I could by any means ſoften the af. 
fliction which I cannot affect not to per- 
ceive, and which has ſo warmly inte- 
reſted my feelings, I ſhould regard this 
as one cf the moſt happy moments of 
my life; alife marked, alas! too ſtrong- 

ly 


(87 | 
ly with miſer; ! but miſery has not been 


uſeleſs, ſince it has taught me ſympa- 
thy.“ The Baroneſs was no ftranger to 
the character and the misfortunes of the 


Earl. Herſelf the victim of oppreſſion, 
ſhe knew how to commiſerate the ſuffer- 
ings of others. She had ever felt a tender 
compaſſion for the misfortunes of Oſbert, 
and did not now with-hold ſincere ex- 
preſſions of ſympathy, and of gratitude, 
for the intereſt which he felt in her ſor- 
row. She expreſſed her ſurprize at 
ſeeing him thus at liberty; but obſerving 
the chains which encircled his hands, 
ſhe ſhuddered, and gueſſed a part of the 
truth. He explained to her the diſco- 
very of the pannel, by which circum- 
ſtance he had found his way into that 
apartment. The idea of aiding him to 
eſcape, ruſhed upon the mind of the 
Baroneſs, but was repreſled by the con- 
ſideration of her own confined ſituation , 
and ſhe was compelled, with mournful 


reluctance, to reſign that thought which 


G 4 reverence 


(. 228 5 


reverence for the character of the late 
Earl, and compaſſion for the misfortunes 
of the preſent, had inſpired. She la- 
mented her inability to aſſiſt him, and 
informed him that herſelf and her 
daughter were alike priſoners with him- 
ſelf; that the walls of the caſtle were 
the limits of their liberty ; and that they 
had ſuffered the preſſure of tyranny for 
fifteen years. The Earl expreſſed the 
indignation which he felt at this reci- 
tal, and ſolicited the Baroneſs to confide 
in his integrity; and, if the relation 
would not be too painful to her, to ho- 
nour him ſo far as to acquaint. him by 
what cruel means ſhe fell into the power 
of Malcolm. The Baroneſs, apprehen- 
five for his ſafety, reminded him of the 
riſK of diſcovery by a longer abſence 
from his priſon; and, ' thanking him 
again for the intereſt he took in her ſuf- 
ferings, aſſured him. of her warmeſt 
wiſhes for his deliverance, and that if 
an opportunity ever offered, ſhe would 

acquaint, 


* 


661 


acquaint him with the ſad particulars of 
her ſtory. The eyes of Oſbert made 
known that gratitude which it was diffi- 
cult for his tongue to utter. Tremu- 
louſly he ſolicited the conſolation of 
ſometimes re- viſiting the apartments of 
the Baroneſs; a permiſſion which would 
give him ſome intervals of comfort 
amid the many hours of torment to 
which he was condemned. The Ba- 
roneſs, in compaſſion to his ſufferings, 
granted the requeſt. The Earl de- 
parted, gazing on Laura with eyes of 
mourntul tenderneſs; yet he was pleaſed 
with what had paſſed, and retired to his 
priſon in one of thoſe peaceful inter- 
vals which are known even to the 
wretched. He found all quiet, and 
cloſing the pannel in ſafety, ſat down to 
conſider the paſt, and anticipate the fu- 
ture. He was flattered with hopes, that 
the diſcovery of the pannel might aid 
him to eſcape; the glooms of deſpond- 
ence which had lately enveloped his 
1 5 1 


( 239 ) 


mind, gradually diſappeared, and joy 
once more illumined his proſpects; but 
it was the ſunſhine of an April morn, 
deceitful and momentary, He recol- 
lected that the caſtle was beſet with 
guards, whoſe vigilance was infured by 
the ſeverity of the Baron; he remem- 
bered that the ſtrangers, who had taken 
ſo kind an intereſt in his fate, were pri- 
ſoners like himſelf; and that he had no 
generous ſoldier to teach him the ſecret 
windings of the caſtle, and to accom- 
pany him in flight, His imagination 
was haunted by the image of Laura; 
vainly he ſtrove to diſguiſe from him- 
ſelf the truth ; his heart conſtantly be- 
lied the ſophiſtry of his reaſonings. Un- 
warily he had drank the draught of 
love, and he was compelled to acknow- 
ledge the fatal indiſcretion. He could 
not, however, reſolve to throw from his 
heart the delicious poiſon; he could 
not refolve to ſee her no more. The 


painful apprehenſion for his ſafety, 
which 


( 634 

which his forbearing to renew the viſit 
he had ſo earneſtly ſolicited, would oc- 
caſion the Baroneſs ; the apparent dif- 
reſpect it would convey; the ardent 
curiofity with which he longed to ob- 
tain the hiſtory of her misfortunes; the 
lively intereſt he felt in learning the 
ſituation of Laura, with reſpect to the 
Baron; and the hope,—the wild hope, 
with which he deluded his reaſon, that 
he might be able to aſſiſt them, deter- 
mined him to repeat the viſit. Under 
. theſe illuſtons, the motive which prin- 
cipally impelled him to the interview 
was concealed, 


In the mean time Alleyn had re- 
turned to the caſtle of Athlin with the 
reſolutions of the Earl; whoſe reſolves 
ſerved only to aggravate the diſtreſs of 
its fair inhabitants. Alleyn, however, 
unwilling to cruſh a laſt hope, tenderly 
concealed from them the circumſtance 


of the Earl's removal from the tower; 
G 6 ſilently 


( 32) 
ſilently and abmoſt hopeleſsly meditating 
.to diſcover his priſon; and adminif- 
tered that comfort to the Counteſs and 
to Mary, which his own expectation 
would not ſuffer him to participate. He 
retired in haſte to the veterans whom 
he had before aſſembled, and acquaint- 
ed them with the removal of the Earl; 
which circumſtance muſt for the pre- 
"ſent ſuſpend their conſultations. He 
left them, therefore, and inſtantly re- 
turned to the clan: there to proſecute | 
his enquiries. Every poſhble exertion 
was made to obtain the neceſſary ihtel- 
ligence, but without ſucceſs. The 
moment in which the Baron would de- 
mand the anſwer ef the Counteſs, was 
now faſt approaching, and every heart 
ſunk in deſpair, when one night the cen- 
tinels of the camp were alarmed by the 
approach of men, who hailed them in 
unknown voices; fearful of ſurprize, 
they ſurrounded the ſtrangers, and led 
them to Alleyn; to whom they related, 
? | that 


( 133 .) 
that they fled from the capricious tyran- 
ny of Malcolm, and ſought refuge in 


the camp of his enemy; whoſe misfor- 


tunes they bewailed, and in whoſe cauſe 
they enliſted. Rejoiced at the circum- 
ſtance, yet doubtful of its truth, Alleyn 
interrogated the ſoldiers concerning the 
priſon of the Earl. From them he 
learned, that Oſbert was confined in a 
part of the caſtle extremely difficult of 
acceſs; and that any plan of eſcape 
muſt be utrerly impracticable wrthout 
the aſſiſtance of one well acquainted 
with the various intricacies of the pile. 
An opportunity of ſucceſs was now pre- 
fented, with which the moſt ſanguine 
hopes of Alleyn had never flattered 
him. He received from the ſoldiers 
ſtrong aſſurances of aſſiſtance; from 
them, likewiſe, he learned, that diſcon- 
tent reigned among the people of the 
Baron; who, impatient of the yoke of 
tyranny, only waited a favourable op- 
portunity to throw it off, and W 
1430 the

the rights of nature. That the vigilant 
ſuſpicions of Malcolm excited him to 
puniſh with the harſheſt ſeverity every 
appearance of inattention; that being 
condemned to ſuffer a very heavy pu- 
niſhment for a ſlight offence, they had 
eluded the impending miſery, and the 
future oppreſſion of their Chief, by 
deſertion. 


Alleyn immediately convened a coun- 
cil, before whom the ſoldiers were 
brought; they repeated their former 
aſſertions; and one of the fugitives 
added, that he had a brother, whoſe 
place of guard over the perſon of the 
Earl on that night, had made it difficult 
to elude obſervation, and had prevented 
his eſcaping with them ; that on the 
night of the morrow he ſtood guard at 
the gate of the leſſer draw-bridge, where 
the centinels were few; that he was 
himſelf willing to riſque the danger of 
* with him; and had little 
doubt 


( 235 3 


doubt of gaining him to aſſiſt in the de- 
liverance of the Earl. At theſe words, 
the heart of Alleyn throbbed with joy, 
He promiſed large rewards to the brave 
ſoldier and to his brother, if they un- 
dertook the enterprize. His companion 
was well acquainted with the ſubter- 
raneous paſſages of the rock, and ex- 
preſſed himſelf deſirous of being uſeful. 
The hopes of Alleyn every inſtant grew 
ſtronger; and he vainly withed, at that 
moment, to communicate to the Earl's 
unhappy family the joy which dilated 
his heart. 


The eve of the following day was 
fixed upon to commence their deſigns; 
when James ſhould endeavour to gain 
his brother to their purpoſe. Having 
adjuſted theſe matters, they retired to 
reſt for the remainder of the night; but 
ſleep had fled the eyes of Alleyn; anxi- 
ous expeQation filled his mind; and 
he ſaw, in the waking viſions of fancy,

the meeting of the Earl with his family; 


he anticipated the thanks he ſhould re- 


ceive from the lovely Mary; and he 


ſighed at the recollection, that thanks 


were all for which he could ever dare to 


hope. 


At length the dawn appeared, and 
waked the clan to hopes and proſpects 
far ditferent from thoſe of the preceding 
morn. The hours hung heavily on the 
expectation of Alleyn, whoſe mind was 
filled with ſolicitude for the event of the 
meeting between the brothers. Night 
at length came to his wiſhes. The 
darkneſs was interrupted ' only by the 
faint light of the moon moving through 


the watery and broken clouds, which en- 
veloped the horizon. Tumultuous guſts 


of wind broke at intervals the filence of 


the hour. Alleyn watched the move- 
ments of the caſtle; he obſerved the 


lights ſucceſſively difappear. The bell 
from the watch-tower chimed one; all 


Was 


1 


was ſtill within the walls; and James 
ventured forth to the draw-bridge. The 
draw-bridge divided in the center, and 
the half next the plains was down; he 
mounted it, and in a low yet firm voice, 
called on Edmund. No anſwer was re- 
turned ; and he began to fear that his 
brother had already quitted the caſtle, 
He remained ſome time in filent ſuſ- 
penſe before he repeated the call, when 
he heard the gate of the draw- bridge 
gently unbarred, and Edmund appeared. 
He was ſurprized to ſee James, and 
bade him inſtantly fly the danger that 
ſurrounded him. The Baron, incenſed 
at the frequent deſertion of his ſoldiers, 
had ſent out people in purſuit, and had 
promiſed conſiderable rewards for the 
apprehenſion of the fugitives. James, 
undaunted by what he heard, kept his 
ground, reſolved to urge his purpoſe to 
the point. Happily the centinels who 
{ſtood guard with Edmund, overcome 
with the effect of a potion he had admi-

niſtered to favour his eſcape, were ſunk 


in ſleep, and the ſoldiers conducted their 
diſcourſe in a low voice without inter- 
ruption. | 


Edmund was unwilling to deter his 
flight, and poſſeſſed not reſolution ſuffi- 


_ cient to encounter the hazard of the en- 


terprize, till the proffered reward con- 
foled his ſelf-denial, and rouſed his 


{lumbering courage. He was well ac- 


quainted with the ſubterraneous avenues 
of the caſtle; the only remaining diffi- 
culty, was that of deceiving the vigi- 
lance of his fellow-centinels, whoſe 
watchfulneſs made it impoſſible for the 
Earl to quit his priſon unperceived. 
The ſoldiers who were to mount guard 
with him on the following night, were 
ſtationed in a diſtant part of the caſtle, 
till the hour of their removal to the 
door of the priſon; it was, therefore, 
difficult to adminiſter to them that 
draught which had ſteeped in forget- 

fulneſs 


fa 7 

fulneſs the ſenſes of his preſent aſſociates. 
To conſide to their integrity, and endea- 
vour to win them to his purpoſe, was 
certainly to give his life into their hands, 
and probably to aggravate the diſaſtrous 
fate of the Earl. This ſcheme was be- 
fer too thick with dangers to- be ha- 
zarded, and their invention could fur- 
niſn them with none more promiling. 
It was, however, agreed, that on the 
following night, Edmund ſhould ſeize 
the moment of opportunity to impart to 
the Earl the deſigns of his friends, and 
to conſult on the means of accompliſh- 
ing them. Thus concluding, James 
returned in ſafety to the tent of Alleyn, 
where the moſt conſiderable of the clan 
were aſſembled, there awaiting with im- 
patient ſolicitude, his arrival. The 
hopes of Alleyn were ſomewhat chilled 
by the report of the ſoldier; from the 
vigilance which beſet the doors of the 
priſon, eſcape from thence appeared im- 
practicable. He was condemned, how- 

| | ever, { 


— — —— ——— · ·˖**·²ð³ — 


(ao 


ever, to linger in ſuſpenſe till the third 
night from the preſent, when the return 
of Edmund to his ſtation at the bridge 


would enable him again to commune 


with his brother. But Alleyn was unſuſ- 
picious of a circumſtance which would 
utterly have defeated his hopes, and 
whoſe conſequence threatened deſtruc- 
tion to all their ſchemes. A centinel 


on duty upon that part of the rampart 
which ſurmounted the he draw-bridge, had 
been alarmed by hearing the gate unbar, 


and approaching the wall, had perceived 


a man ſtanding on the half of the bridge 
which was dropped, and in converſe 
with ſome perſon on the caſtle walls. 
"I drew as near as the wall would per- 


mit, and endeavoured to liſten to their 


diſcourſe. The gloom of night pre- 


vented his recognizing the perſon on the 


bridge; but he could clearly diſtin- 


guiſh the voice of Edmund in that 
of the man who was addreſſed. Ex- 


cited by new wonder, he gave all his 


attention 


E 


attention to diſcover the ſubject of their 
converſation. The diſtance occaſioned 
between the brothers by the ſuſpended 
half of the bridge, obliged them to ſpeak 
in a ſomewhat higher tone than they 
would otherwiſe have done; and the 
centinel gathered ſufficient from their 
diſcourſe, to learn that they were con- 
certing the reſcue of the Earl; that the 
night of Edmund's watch at the priſon 
was to be the night of enterprize; and 
that ſome friends of the Earl were to 
await him in the environs of the caſtle. 
All this he carefully treaſured up, and 
the next morning communicated it to 
his comrades. 


On the following evening the Earl, 
yielding to the impulſe of his heart, 
once more uncloſed his partition, and 
ſought the apartments of the Baroneſs. 
She received him with expreſſions of 
ſatisfaction ; while the artleſs. pleaſure

Laura, awakened the pulſe of rapture in 
that heart which had long throbbed only 
to miſcry. The Earl reminded the Ba- 


roneſs of her former promiſe, which the 


deſire of exciting ſympathy in thoſe we 
eſteem,and the melancholy pleaſure which 
the heart finds in lingering among the 
ſcenes of former happineſs, had induced 
her to give. She endeavoured to com- 
poſe her ſpirits, which were agitated by 
the remembrance of paſt ſufferings, and 
gave him a relation of the following 
circumſtances.

CHAPTER vn. 


OUISA, Baroneſs Malcolm, was 


the deſcendant of an ancient and 


honourable houſe in Switzerland, Her 
father, the Marquis de St. Claire, inhe- 
rited all thoſe brave qualities, and that 
ſtern virtue, which had ſo eminently diſ- 
tinguiſhed his anceſtors. Early in life 
he loſt a wife whom he tenderly loved, 
and he ſeemed to derive his ſole conſo- 
lation from the education of the dear 
children ſhe had left behind. His ſon, 
whom he had brought up to the arms 
himſelf ſo honourably bore, fell before 
he reached his nineteenth year, in the 


ſervice of his country; an elder daughter 


died in infancy; Louiſa was his ſole 
ſurviving child. His chateau was fitu- 
ated in one of thoſe delightful vallies of 
the Swiſs cantons, in which the beauti- 
ful and the ſublime are ſo happily uni- 


ted; where the magnificent features of 
the 


: 222 ͤͥr»... ³˙¹¹wꝛA

the ſcenery are contraſted, and their ef. 
fect heightened by the blooming luxu- 
riance of woods and paſturage, by the 
gentle. windings of the ſtream, and the 
peaceful aſpect of the cottage. The 
Marquis was now. retired from the ſer- 
vice, for grey age had overtaken, him. 
His reſidence was the reſort of foreign- 
ers of diſtinction, who, attracted by the 
united talents of the ſoldier and the 
philoſopher, under his roof partook of 
the hoſpitality ſo characteriſtic of his 
country. Among the viſitors of this 
deſcription was the late Baron Mal- 
colm, brother to the preſent Chief, who 
then travelled through Switzerland. 
The beauty of Louiſa, embelliſhed: by 
the elegance of a mind highly culti- 
vated, touched his heart, and he ſoli- 
cited her hand in marriage. The manly 
Tenſe of the Baron, and the excellencies 
of his diſpoſition, had not paſſed unob- 
ſerved, or unapproved by the Marquis; 


while the graces of his perſon, and of 
| | his 


( 145 ) 
his mind, had anticipated for him, in the 
heart of Louiſa, a pre-emitience over 
every other ſuitor. - The Marquis had 
but one objection to the marriage; this 
was likewiſe the, objection of Louiſa: 
neither the one nor the other could en- 
dure the idea of the diſtance which was 
to feparate them. Louiſa was to the 
Marquis the laſt prop of his declining 
years; the Marquis was to Louiſa the 
father and the friend to whom her heart 
had hitherto been ſolely devoted, and 
from whom it could not now be torn 
but with an anguiſh equal to its attach- 
ment. This remained an inſurmount- 
able obſtacle, till it was removed by the 
tenderneſs of the Baron, who entreated 
the Marquis to quit Switzerland, and 
reſide with his daughter in Scotland. 
The attachment of the Marquis to his 
natal land, and the pride of hereditary 
dominion, was too powerful to ſuffer him 
to acquieſce in the propoſal without 


much ſtruggle of contending feelings.

The deſire of ſecuring the happineſs of 


his child, by a union with a character ſo 


excellent as the Baron's, and of ſeeing 


her ſettled before death ſhould deprive 
her of the protection of a father, at 
length ſubdued every other conſidera- 
tion, and he reſigned the hand of his 
daughter to the Baron Malcolm. The 
Marquis adjuſted his affairs, and con- 
ſigning his eſtates to the care of truſty 
agents, bade a laſt adieu to his beloved 
country ; that country which, during 
fixty years, had been the principal 
ſcene of his happineſs, and of his re- 
grets. The courſe of years had not ob- 
literated from his heart the early affec- 
tions of his youth: he took a ſad fare- 
well of that grave which encloſed the 
reliques of his wife, from which it was 
not his leaſt effort to depart, and whi- 
ther he ordered that his remains ſhould 
be conveyed. Louiſa quitted Switzer- 
land with a concern ſcarcely leſs acute 
than that of her father; the poignancy

of which, however, WAS greatly ſoftened 
by the tender aſſiduities of her Lord, 
whoſe affectionate attentions hourly 


_ heightened her eſteem, and encreaſed 


her love. 


They arrived at Scotland without any 
accident, where the Baron welcomed 
Louiſa as the miſtreſs of his domains. 
The Marquis de St. Claire had apart- 
ments in the caſtle, where the evening 
of his days declined in peaceful hap- 
pineſs. Before his death, he had the 
pleaſure of ſeeing his race renewed in 
the children of the Baroneſs, in a ſon

of once more beholding her native coun- 
try, and anxious to pay a laſt reſpect to 
the memory of her father, entruſted her 


children to the care of a faithful old ſer- 


vant, whom ſhe had brought with her 
from the Vallois, and who had been the 
nurſe of her early childhood, and accom- 
panied the Baron to the continent. 
Having depoſited the remains of the 
Marquis according to his wiſh in the 
tomb of his wife, and arranged their 
affairs, they returned to Scotland, where 
the firſt intelligence they received on 


their arrival at the caſtle, was of the death 


of their ſon, and of the old nurſe his at- 
tendant. The ſervant had died ſoon 
aſter their departure; the child only a 
fortnight before their return. This diſ- 
aſtrous event affected equally the Baron 
and his lady, who never ceaſed to con-

affliction, but came fraught with another 


'yet more acute; this was the death of 


the Baron, who, in the pride of youth, 
conſlituting the felicity of his family, 
and of his people, was killed by a fall 
from his horſe, which he received in 
hunting: He left the Baroneſs and an 
only daughter to bewail with unceaſing 


ſorrow his loſs. 


The paternal eſtates devolved of 


courſe to his only brother, the preſent. 
Baron, whoſe character formed a mourn- 


ful and ſtriking contraſt to that of the 
deceaſed Lord. All his perſonal pro- 
perty, which was conſiderable, with the 


eſtates in Switzerland, he bequeathed to 
his beloved wife and daughter. The 
new Baron, immediately on the demiſe 
of his brother, took poſſeſſion of the 
caſtle, but allowed the Baroneſs, with a 
part of her ſuit, to remain its inhabi- 


tant till the expiration of the year. The 


Baroneſs, abſorbed in grief, ſtill loved to

recall, in the ſcene of her late felicity, 
the image of her Lord, and to linger in 
his former haunts. This motive, toge- 


ther with the neceſſity of preparation for 


a journey to Switzerland, induced her to 
accept the offer of the Baron. 


The memory of his brother had 
quickly faded from the mind of Mal- 
colm, whoſe attention appeared to be 
wholly occupied by ſchemes of ava- 
rice and ambition. His arrogance, 
and boundleſs love of power, em- 
broiled him with the neighbouring 
Chiefs, and engaged him in continual 
hoſtility. He ſeldom viſited the Ba- 


roneſs; when he did, his manner was 


Cold, and even haughty. The Baroneſs, 
ſhocked to receive ſuch treatment from 
the brother of her deceaſed Lord, and 


reduced to feel herſelf an unwelcome 


gueſt in that caſtle which ſhe had been 
accuſtomed to conſider as her own, de- 
termined to ſet off for the continent im-

her native mountains, an aſylum from 
the frown of inſulting power. The con- 
traſt of character between the brothers 
drew many a ſigh of bitter recollection 
from her heart, and added weight to the 
ſorrows which already oppreſſed it. She 
gave orders, therefore, to her domeſtics, 
to prepare for immediate departure; 
but was ſoon after told that the Baron 
had forbad them to obey the command. 
Aſtoniſhed at this circumſtance, ſhe had 
not time to demand an explanation, ere 
a meſſage from Malcolm required a few 
moments private converſation. The 
meſſenger was followed almoſt inſtantly 
by the Baron, who entered the apart- 
ment with hurried ſteps, his counte- 
nance overſpread with the dark purpoſes 
of his ſoul. «© I come, Madam,“ ſaid 
he, in a voice ſtern and determined, 
« to inform you, that you quit not this 
caſtle. The eſtates which you call yours, 
are mine; and think not that I ſhall

frequent and ill-timed generoſities of 
my brother, have diminiſhed the value 


of the lands which are mine by inhe-

penſable right to re- pay myſelf from 
thoſe eſtates which he acquired with 
you. In point of juſtice, he poſſeſſed 
not the right of deviſing -theſe eſtates, 
and I ſhall not ſuffer myſelf to be de- 
ceived by the evaſions of the law; re- 
ſign, therefore, the will, which remains 
only a record of unjuſt wiſhes, and inef- 
fectual elaims. When the receipts from 
your eſtates have ſatisfied niy demands, 
they ſhall again be yours. The apart&lt;- 
ments you now inhabit ſhall remain your 
own; but beyond the wall of this caſtle 


you ſhall not paſs; for I will not, by

Overcome with aſtoniſhment” and 
dread, the Baroneſs was for ſome time 
deprived. of all power of reply. At 
length, roufed by the ſpirit of indigna- 
tion; © T am too well informed, my 
Lord,“ ſaid ſhe, of my juſt claims to 
the lands in queſtion; and know alſo 
too well the value of that integrity 
which is now no more, to credit your 
bold affertions; they ſerve only to un- 
veil to me the darkneſs of a character, 
cruel and rapacious; whoſe boundleſs 
avarice, trampling on the barriers of juſ- 
tice and humanity, ſeizes on the right 
of the defenceleſs widow, and on the 
portion of the unreſiſting orphan. This, 
my Lord, you are permitted to do; 
they have no means of reſiſtance; but 
think not to impoſe on me by a ſophiſti- 
cal aſſertion of right, or to gloſs the vil- 
lany of your conduct with the colours 
of juſtice; the artifice 1s beneath the 
deſperate force of your character, and 1s 
not ſufficiently ſpecious to deceive the

diſcernment of virtue. From being 
your priſoner I have no means of eſcap- 
ing; but never, my Lord, will I reſign 
into your hands that will which is the 
efficient bond of my rights, and the laſt 
fad record of the affection of my de- 
parted Lord.” Grief cloſed her lips. 
The Baron denouncing vengeance on 
her reſiſtance, his features inflamed with 
rage, quitted the apartment. The Ba- 
roneſs was left to lament, with deepening 
anguiſh, the ſtroke which had deprived 
her of a beloved huſband; and reflection 
gave her the wretchedneſs of her ſitua- 
tion in yet more lively colours. She 
was now a ſtranger in a foreign land, 
deprived by him, of whom ſhe had a 
right to demand protection, of all her 
poſſeſſions; a priſoner in his caſtle, 
without one friend to vindicate her 
cauſe, and far remote from any means 
of appeal to the laws of the country. 
She wept over the youthful Laura, and

It was at this period that the Baronefs 


communicated to the Earl the — of 
her calamities. 


The Earl liſtened with deep attention 
to the recital. His ſoul burned with 
indignation againſt the Baron, while 
his heart gave to the ſufferings of the 
fair mourners all that ſympathy could 
aſk. Yet he was relieved from a very 
painful ſenſation, when he learned that 
the beauty of Laura had not influenced 
the conduct of the Baron. Her op- 
preſſed ſituation ſtruck upon his heart 


the fineſt touch of pity; and the paſſion 


which her beauty and her fimplicity 
had inſpired, was ſtrengthened and me- 
liorated by her misfortunes. The fate 
of his father, and the idea of his own 
injuries, ruſhed upon his mind; and,

to that he had ſuffered in his firſt inter- 
view with the Baron. Every conſider- 
ation ſunk before the impulſe of a juſt 
revenge; his mind, occupied with the 
hateful image of the murderer was har- 
dened againſt danger, and in the firſt 


_ energies of his reſentment he would have 


ruſhed to the apartment of Malcolm, and 


ſtriking the ſword of juſtice in his heart, 


have delivered the earth from a monſter, 
and have reſigned himſelf the willing ſa-

ſter live? cried he, riſing from his ſeat. 
His ſtep was hurried, and his counte- 
nance was ſtamped with a ſtern virtue. 
The Baronefs was alarmed, and follow- 
ing him to the door of her apartment, 
which he had half opened, conjured him 
to. pauſe for a moment on the dangers 
that ſurrounded him. The voice of

CHAPTER VIII. 


E had now 83 a partition, 

1 and was entering the room, when, 
by the faint gleam which the fire threw 
acroſs the apartment, he perceived indiſ- 
tinctly the, figure of a man, and in the 
fame inſtant heard the ſound of ap- 
proaching armour. Surprize and horror 
thrilled through every nerve: he re- 
mained fixed to the ſpot, and for ſome 
moments heſitated whether to retire. A 
fearful ſibence enſuęed; the perſon whom 
he thought he had ſeen, diſappeared in 
the darkneſs of the room; the noiſe of 
armour was heard no more; and he 


began to think that the figure he had 


ſeen, and the ſound he had heard, were 
the phantoms of a ſick imagination, 
which the agitation of his ſpirits, the 
ſolemnity of the hour, and the wide de- 
ſolation of the place, had conjured up.

The low ſounds of an unknown voice 
now ſtarted upon his ear; it ſeemed to 
be almoſt cloſe beſide him; he ſprung 
onward, and his hand graſped the ſteely 
coldneſs of armour, while the arm it 
encloſed ſtruggled to get free. « Speak! 
what wretch art thou?” cried Ofbert, 
when a ſudden blaze of light from the 
fire diſcovered to him a ſoldier of. the 


Baron. His agitation for fome time 


prevented his obſerving that there was 
more of alarm than of defign expreſſed 
in the countenance of the man ; but the 
apprehenſion of the Earl was quickly 
loſt in aſtoniſhment, when he beheld 
the guard at his feet. It was Edmund 
who had entered the priſon under pre- 


tence of carrying fuel to the fire, but 
fecretly for the purpoſe of conferring 


with Oſbert. When the Earl under. 
ſtood he came from Alleyn, his boſom 
glowed with gratitude towards that ge- 
nerous youth, whoſe ſteady and active 


zeal had never relaxed fince the hour in 
which 


208 


( 9 1] 


which he firſt engaged in his cauſe. 
The tranſport of his heart may be eaſily 
imagined, when he learned the ſchemes 
that were planning for his deliverance, 
The circumſtance which had nearly de- 
feated the warm hopes of his friends, 
was by him diſregarded, fince the 
knowledge of the ſecret door opened to 
him, with the aſſiſtance of a guide 
through the intricacies of the caſtle, a 
certain means of eſcape. Edmund was 
well acquainted with all theſe. The 


Earl told him of the diſcovery of 


the falſe pannel; bade him return 
to Alleyn with the joyful intelligence, 
and on his next night of watch 
prepare to aid him in eſcape. Ed- 
mund knew well the apartments which 
Oſbert deſcribed, and the great ſtair- 
caſe which led into a part of the caſtle 
that had long been totally forſaken, and 
from whence it was eaſy to paſs unob- 


ſerved into the vaults which communi-

Alleyn heard the report of James with 


a warm and generous joy, which impelled 


him to haſten immediately to the caſtle of 
Athlin, and diſpel the ſorrows that in- 
habited there; but the conſideration 
that his ſudden abſence from the camp 
might oreate ſuſpicion, and invite dif 
covery, checked the impulſe; and he 


yielded with reluctance to the neceſſity 


which condemned the Counteſs and 
Mary to the horrors of a Ae 
e 21 lu * n 
The Sant nnn aids Jo, 
F igns, ſtrengthened by the ſteady deter- 
mination of Mary, were unſhaken by the 
meſſage of the Earl, which ſhe conſidered 
as only the effect of a momentary im- 
pulſe, watched the gradual departure of 
thoſe days which led to that which enve- 
loped the fate of her children, with ago-

ny and fainting hope. She received no 
news from the camp; no words of com« 


fort from Alleyn; and ſhe ſaw the confi- 


dence which had nouriſhed her exiſtence 
ſlowly ſinking in deſpair. Mary ſought 
to adminiſter that comfort to the afflic- 
tions of her mother, which her own 


equally demanded; ſhe ſtrove, by the 


fortitude with which ſhe endeavoured to 
reſign herſelf, to ſoften the aſperity of 
the ſufferings which threatened the 
Counteſs; and ſhe contemplated the 
approaching ſtorm with the determined 
coolneſs of a mind aſpiring to virtue as 
the chief good. But ſhe ſedulouſly 
ſought to exclude Alleyn from her 
mind; his diſintereſted and noble con- 
duct excited emotions dangerous to her 
fortitude, and which rendered yet more 


poignant the tortures of the approaching 


ſacrifice.

Laura, and to ſeize the laſt opportunity 
he might ever poſleſs of diſcloſing to her 
his admiration and his love, the Earl re- 
viſited the apartments of the Baroneſs. 
She felt a lively pleaſure on the proſpect 
of his eſcape; and Laura, in the joy 
which animated her on hearing this in- 
telligence, forgot the ſorrows of her own 
ſituation; forgot that of which her heart

and that ſhe ſhould probably ſee him no

ſhade over her features, and from the 
enlivening expreſſion of joy, they re- 
ſumed their wonted melancholy. Oſbert 
marked the momentary change, and his 


heart ſpoke to him the occaſion. «© My

feelings will not ſuffer me at this mo-

from whence I fly with eagerneſs, I 


leave a heart fraught with the moſt ten- 


der paſſion ;—a heart which, while it 
beats with life, muſt ever- unite the 
image of Laura with the fondneſs of 
love. Could J hope that ſhe were not

even certain that ſhe would repel my 


love with cold indifference, 1 would 
yet, if ſhe accept my ſervices, effect her 
reſcue, or give my life the forfeiture.” 


Laura was filent; ſhe wiſhed to ſpeak 


her gratitude, yet feared to tell her love; 
but the ſoft timidity of her eye, and the 
tender glow of her cheek, revealed the 
ſecret that. trembled on her lips. The 
Baroneſs obſerved her confuſion, and 
thanking the Earl for the noble ſervice 
he offered, declined accepting it. She

the ſilence of Laura yielded acqui-

many - earneſt wiſhes for his ſafety, the 
Earl quitted the apartment elated with 


hope. But the Baron had been in- 
formed of his projected eſcape, and had 


ſtudied the means of counteracting it. 


The centinel had communicated his 


diſcovery to ſome of his comrades, who, 
without virtue or courage ſufficient to

their purpoſe. They communicated to 
their Chief the intelligence they had 
received. 


Malcolm, careful to conceal his know 


ledge of the ſcheme, from a deſign to 
entrap thoſe of the clan who were to 
meet the Earl, had ſuffered Edmund to 
return to his ſtation at the priſon, where 
he had placed the informers as ſecret 


guards, and had taken ſuch other pre- 


cautions as were neceſſary to intercept 
their flight, ſhould they elude the vigi- 
lance of the ſoldiers, and likewiſe to ſe- 
cure thoſe of his people who ſhould be 
drawn toward the caſtle in expectation of 
their Chief. Having done this, he 


prided himſelf in ſecurity, and in the 


certainty of exulting over his enemies, 
thus entangled in their own ſtratagem. 


After many weary moments of impa- 
tience to Alleyn, and of expectation to 
the Earl, the night at length arrived on 

1 which

which hung the event of all their hopes. 
It was agreed that Alleyn, with a choſen 


few, ſhould await the arrival of the 


Earl in the cavern where terminated 
the ſubterraneous avenue. Alleyn parted 
from James with extreme agitation, and 
returned to his tent to compoſe his 
mind. | 


It was now the dead of night; pro- 
found ſleep reigned through the caſtle 
of Dunbayne, when Edmund gently 
unbolted the priſon door, and hailed the 
Earl, He ſprung forward, and inſtantly 
uncloſed the pannel, which they faſ- 
tened after them to prevent diſcovery, 
and paſling with fearful ſteps the cold 
and filent apartments, deſcended the 
great ſtalr-caſe into the hall, whoſe 
wide and dark deſolation was rendered 
viſible only by the dim light of the 
taper which Edmund carried in his 
hand, and whoſe vaulted ceiling re- 
echoed their ſteps. After various wind-

paſſing their dreary length they often 
pauſed in fearful filence, liſtening to the 
hollow blaſts which burſt ſuddenly 


through the paſſages, and which ſeemed 


to bear in the ſound the footſteps of 
purſuit. At length they reached the 
extremity of the vaults, where Edmund 
ſearched for a trap-door which lay al- 
molt concealed in the dirt and darkneſs; 
after ſome time they found, and with 
difficulty raiſed it, for it was long ſince 
it had been opened; and it was beſides 


heavy with iron work. They entered, 
and letting the door fall after them, 


deſcended a narrow flight of ſteps 
which conducted them to a winding 
paſſage cloſed by a door that opened into 
the main avenue whence Alleyn had 
before made his eſcape. Having gained 
this, they ſtepped on with confidence, 


for they where now not far from the ca- 


vern were Alleyn and his companions 
were awaiting their arrival. The heart 
12 | of

„ 


of Alleyn now ſwelled with joy, for he 
perceived a gleam of diſtant light break 
upon the walls of the avenue, and at the 
ſame time thought he heard the faint 
ſound of approaching footſteps. Im- 
patient to throw himſelf at the feet of 
the Earl, he entered the avenue. The 
light grew ſtronger upon the walls; but 
a a point of rock, whoſe projection cauſed 
a winding in the paſſage, concealed from 
his view the perſons his eyes ſo eagerly 
fought. The ſound of ſteps was now 
faſt approaching, and Alleyn gaining 
the rock, ſuddenly turned upon three 
ſoldiers of the Baron. They inſtantly 
ſeized him their priſoner. Aſtoniſh- 
ment for a while overcame every other 
ſenſation; but as they led him along, the 
horrid reverſe of the moment ſtruck 
upon his heart with all its conſequences, 
and he had no doubt that the Earl had 
been ſeized and carred back to his pri- 
ſon. As he marched along, abſorbed in 
this reflection, a light appeared at

ſame diſtance, from a door that opened 
upon the avenue, and diſcovered the 
figures of two men, who on perceiving 
the party, retreated with precipitation, 
and cloſed the door after them. Alleyn 
knew the Earl in the perſon of one of 
them. Two of the ſoldiers quitting 
Alleyn, purſued the fugitives, and 
quickly diſappeared through a door. 
Alleyn finding himſelf alone with the 


guard, ſeized the moment of opportu- 


nity, and made a deſperate effort to re- 
gain his ſword. He ſucceeded; and in 
the ſuddenneſs of the attack, obtained 
alſo the weapon of his adverſary, who, 
unarmed, fell at his feet, and called for 
mercy. Alleyn gave him his life. The 
ſoldier, grateful for the gift, and fearful 
of the Baron's vengeance, deſired to fly 
with him, and enliſt in his ſervice. 


They quitted the ſubterraneous way to- 


gether. On entering the cavern, Alleyn 
found it vacated by his friends, wao on 
hearing the claſh of armour, and the 

13 loud 


( 


loud and menacing voices of the ſol- 
diers, underſtood his fate, and appre- 
henſi ve of numbers, had fled to avoid a 
ſimilar diſaſter. Alleyn returned to his 


tent, ſhocked with diſappointment, and 


loſt in deſpair. Every effort which he 
had made for the deliverance of the 
Earl, had proved unſucceſsful; and this 
ſcheme, on which was ſuſpended his 
laſt hope, had been defeated at the very 
moment when he exulted in its com- 
pletion. He threw himſelf on the 
ground, and loſt in bitter thought, ob- 
ſerved not the curtain of his tent un- 


draw, till recalled by a ſudden noiſe, he 


looked up, and beheld the Earl. Ter- 
ror fixed him to the ſpot, and for a mo- 
ment he involuntarily acknowledged the 


traditionary viſions of his nation. The 


well-known voice of Oſbert, however, 
awakened him to truth, and the ardor 
with which he embraced his knees, 
immediately convinced him that he 


claſped reality. 1

The ſoldiers, in the eagerneſs of pur- 
ſuit, had miſtaken the door by which 
Oſbert had retired, and had entered one 
below it, which, after engaging them in 
a fruitleſs ſearch through various intri- 
cate paſſages, had conducted them to a 


remote part of the caſtle, from whence, 


atter much perplexity and loſs of time, 
they were at length extricated. The 
Earl, who had retreated on fight of the 
ſoldiers, had fled in the mean time to 
regain the trap-door; but the united 
ſtrength of himſelf and of Edmund was 
in vain exerted to open it. Compelled 


to encounter the approaching evil, the 
_ Earl took the ſword of his companion, 


reſolving to meet the approach of his 
adverſaries, and to effect his deliver- 
ance, or yield his life and his misfor- 
tunes to the attempt. With this deſign 
he advanced deliberately along the paſ- 
ſage, and arriving at the door, ſtopped 


to diſcover the motions of his purſuers:

maining ſome time in this ſituation, he 
opened the door, and examining the 


avenue with a firm yet anxious eye as 
far as the light of his taper threw its 


beams, diſcovered no human being. 
He proceeded with cautious firmneſs 
towards the cavern, every inſtant ex- 
pecting the ſoldiers to ſtart ſuddenly 
upon him from ſome dark receſs. — 
With aſtoniſhment he reached the cave 


without interruption ; and unable to ac- 


count for his unexpected deliverance, 


haſtened with Edmund to join his faith- 


ful people. 


The ſoldiers who watched the priſon, 
being ignorant of any other way by 


which the Earl could eſcape, than the 


door which they guarded, had ſuffered 
Edmund to enter the apartment without 
fear. It was ſome time before they 


diſcovered their error; ſurprized at the 


length of his ſtay, they opened the door 
of the priſon, which, to their utter aſto- 
niſhment, 


is.

niſhment, they found empty. The 
grates were examined; they remained 
as uſual; every corner was explored 


but the falſe pannel remained unknown; 


and having finiſned their examination 
without diſcovering any viſible means 
Þy which the Earl had quitted the pri- 
ſon, they were ſeized with terror, con- 
cluding it to be the work of a ſuper- 
natural power, and immediately alarmed 


the caſtle. The Baron, rouſed by the 


tumult, was informed of the fact, and 
dubious of the integrity of his guards, 
aſcended to the apartment; which hav- 
ing himſelf examined without diſcover- 
ing any means of eſcape, he no longer 
heſitated to pronounce the centinels ac- 
ceſſary to the Earl's enlargement. The 


unfeigned terror which they exhibited 


was miſtaken for artifice, and their 
ſuppoſed treachery was admitted and 
puniſned in the ſame moment. They 


were thrown into the dungeon of the 


caſtle. Soldiers were immediately diſ- 


patched in purſuit; but the time 
- "a which 


So 


which had elapſed ere the guards had 
entered the priſon, had given the Earl 
an opportunity of eſcape. When the 
certainty of this was communicated to 
the Baron, every paſſion whoſe ſingle 


force is miſery, united in his breaſt to 
torture him; and his brain, exaſperated ' 


almoſt to madneſs, gave him only dire- 
ful images of revenge. 


The Baroneſs and Laura, awakened by 


the tumult, had been filled with appre- 


henſion for the Earl, till they were in- 
formed of the cauſe of the general con- 
fuſion; and hope and dubious joy were 


ere long confirmed into certainty, for 
they were told of the fruitleſs ſearch of 


the purſuers. 


It was now the laſt day of the term 
in which the Counteſs had ſtipulated to 
return her anſwer; ſhe had yet heard 


nothing from Alleyn; for Alleyn had 
been buſied in ſchemes, of the event of

which he could ſend no account, for 


their ſucceſs had been yet undetermined. 


Every hope of the Earl's deliverance was 
now expired, and in the anguiſh of her 
heart, the Counteſs prepared to give that 
anſwer which would ſend the devoted 
Mary to the arms of the murderer. 
Mary, who aſſumed a fortitude not her 
own, ſtrove to abate the rigor of her 
mother's ſufferings, but vainly ſtrove; 
they were of a nature which defied con- 
ſolation. She wrote the fatal agree- 
ment, but delayed till the laſt moment 
delivering it into the hands of the meſ- 
ſenger. It was neceſlary, however, that 
the Baron ſhould receive it on the fol- 
lowing morn, leſt the impatience of re- 


venge ſhould urge him to ſeize on the 


life of the Earl as the forfeiture of delay. 
She ſent, therefore, for the meſſenger, 
who was a veteran of the clan, and with 
extreme agitation delivered to him her 
anſwer ; grief interrupted her voice; ſhe 
was unable to ſpeak to him; and he was

awaiting her orders, when the door of 
the apartment was thrown open, and 
the Earl, followed by Alleyn, threw 
himſelf at her feet. A faint ſcream was 
uttered by the Counteſs, and ſhe ſunk 
in her chair. Mary, not daring to truſt 
herſelf with the delightful viſion, endea- 
voured to reſtrain the tide of joy, which 
hurried to her heart, and threatened to 
overwhelm her. 


The caſtle of Athlin reſounded with 
tumultuous joy on this happy event; 
the courts were filled with thoſe of the 
clan who had been diſabled from attend- 
ing the field, and whom the report of 
the Earl's return, which had circulated 
with aſtoniſhing rapidity, had brought 
thither. The hall re-echoed with voices; 
and the people could hardly be re- 
{trained from ruſhing into the preſence 
of their Chief, to congratulate him on 
his cſcape. WY

When the firſt tranſports of the meet. 
ing were ſubſided, the Earl preſented 

| Alleyn to his family as his friend and 
deliverer; whoſe ſteady attachment he 
could never forget, and whoſe zealous 
ſervices he could never repay. The 
cheek of Mary glowed with pleaſure and 
gratitude at this tribute to the worth 
of Alleyn; and the ſmiling approbation 
of her eyes rewarded him for his noble 
deeds. The Counteſs received him 
as the deliverer of both her children, 
and related to Oſbert the adventure 
in the wood. The Earl embraced 
Alleyn, who received the united ac- 
knowledgments of the family, with 
unaffected modeſty. Oſbert heſitated 
not to pronounce the Baron the author 
of the plot ; his heart ſwelled to avenge 
the repeated injuries of his family, and 
he ſecretly reſolved to challenge his 
enemy to ſingle combat. To renew the 
ſiege he conſidered as a vain project; 
and this challenge, though a very inade- 
quate mode of revenge, was the only 
: honourable 


( 18a 1 


honourable one that remained for him. 


He forbore to mention his deſign to the 
Counteſs, well knowing that her tender- 
neſs would oppoſe the meaſure, and 


throw difficulties in his way, which 


would embarraſs, without preventing 
his purpoſe. He mentioned the mis- 
fortunes of the Baroneſs, and the love- 
lineſs of her daughter, and excited the 
eſteem and the commiſeration of his 
hearers. 


The clamours of the people to be- 
hold their Lord, now aroſe to the 
apartment of the Counteſs, and he de- 
ſcended into the hall, accompanied by 
Alleyn, to gratify their zeal. An uni- 
verſal ſhout of joy reſounded through 


the walls on his appearance. A noble 
pleaſure glowed on the countenance 


of the Earl at ſight of his faithful peo- 
ple; and inthe delight of that moment 
his heart bore teſtimony to the ſuperior 
advantages of an equitable government. 

The 


Ty 


The Earl, impatient to teſtify his grati- 
tude, introduced Alleyn to the clan, as 
his friend and deliverer, and immedi- 
ately preſented his father with a lot of 
land, where he might end his days in 
peace and plenty. Old Alleyn thanked 
the Earl for his offered kindneſs, but 
declined accepting it; alledging, that 
he was attachgd to his old cottage, and 
that he had already ſufficient for the 


comforts of his * 


On the following morning, a meſſen- 
ger was privately diſpatched to the Ba- 
ron, with the challenge of the Earl. 
The challenge was couched in terms of 
haughty indignation, and expreſſed, that 
nothing but the failure of all other 
means could have urged him to the 
condeſcenſion of meeting the aſſaſſin of 
his father, on terms of equal combat. 


Happineſs was once more reſtored to 


Athlin, The Countels, in the unex- 
by pected 


( 


pected preſervation of her children, 
ſeemed to be alive only to joy. The 
Earl was now for a time ſecure in the 
boſom of his family, and, though his 
impatience to avenge the injuries of 
thoſe moſt dear to him, and to ſnatch 
from the hand of oppreſſion the fair 
ſufferers at Dunbayne, would not allow 
him to be tranquil, yet he aſſumed a 
gaiety unknown to his heart, and the 
days were ſpent in feſtivals and joy. 


CHAP-

CHAPTER IX 


F was at this period, that, one ſtormy 

evening, the Counteſs was ſitting 
with her family in a room, the windows 
of which looked upon the ſea. The 
winds burſt in ſudden ſqualls over the 
deep, and daſhed the foaming waves 
againſt the rocks with inconceivable 
fury. The ſpray, notwithſtanding the 
high ſituation of the caſtle, flew up with 


violence againſt the windows. The 


Earl went out upan the terrace beneath 
to contemplate the ſtorm. The moon 
ſhone faintly by intervals, through bro- 
ken clouds upon the waters, illuming 
the white foam which burſt around, and 
enlightening the ſcene ſufficiently to ren- 
der it viſible. The ſurges broke on the 


_ diſtant ſhores in deep reſounding mur- 


murs, and the ſolemn pauſes between 
the ſtormy guſts filled the mind with 
| enthuſiaſtic 


(- a8 } 


enthuſiaſtic. awe. As the Earl ſtood 
wrapt in the ſublimity of the ſcene, the 
moon, ſuddenly emerging from a heavy 
cloud, ſhewed him at ſome diſtance a 
veſſel! driven by the fury of the blaſt to- 
wards the coaſt. He-preſently heard 
the ſignals of diſtreſs; and ſoon after 
ſhrieks of terror, and a confuſed uproar 
of voices were borne on the wind. He 
haſtened from the terrace to order his 
people to go out with boats to the aſſiſt- 
ance of the crew, for he doubted not 
that the veſſel was wrecked ; but the ſea 
ran ſo high as to make the adventure 
impracticable. The ſound of voices ceaſed, 
and he concluded that the wretched 


mariners were loſt, when the ſcreams of 


_ diſtreſs again ſtruck his ear, and again 
were loſt in the tumult of the ſtorm; in 
a moment after, the veſſel ſtruck upon 
the rock beneath the caſtle; an univer- 
fal ſhriek enſued. The Earl, with his 
people, haſtened to the aſſiſtance of the 
crew; the fury of the guſt was now 

abated,

abated, and the Earl, jumping into a 
boat with Alleyn and ſome others, rowed 


to the ſhip, where they reſcued a part 


of the drowning people. They were 
conducted to the caſtle, and every com- 
fort was liberally adminiſtered to them. 
Among thoſe, whom the Earl had re- 
ceived into his boat, was a ſtranger, 
whoſe dignified aſpect and manners be- 
ſpoke him to be of rank; he had ſeve- 
ral people belonging to him, but they 
were foreigners, and ignorant of the 
language of the country. He thanked 
his deliverer with a noble frankneſs, that 


charmed him. In the hall they were 


met by the Counteſs and her daughter, 


who received the ſtranger with the warm 


welcome, which compaſſion for his ſitua- 
tion had inſpired. He was conducted 
to the ſupper room, where the magnifi- 
cence of the board exhibited only the 
uſual hoſpitality of his hoſt. The ſtran- 
ger ſpoke Engliſh fluently, and diſ- 
played in his converſation a manly and

vigorous mind, acquainted with the 


ſciences, and with life; and the caſt of 


his obſervations ſeemed to characterize 
the benevolence of his heart. The 
Earl was ſo much pleaſed with his gueſs, 
that he preſſed him to remain at his 


caſtle till another veſſel could be procu- 


cured ; his gueſt equally pleaſed with 
the Earl, and a ſtranger to the country, 
accepted the invitation, 


“ 


New diſtreſs now broke upon the 


peace of Athlin; ſeveral days had ex- 


pired, and the meſſenger, who had been 
ſent to Malcolm, did not appear. It 
was almoſt evident, that the Baron, dif- 
appointed and enraged at the eſcape of 
his priſoner, and eager for a ſacrifice, 
had ſeized this man as the ſubject of a 
paltry revenge. The Earl, however, 
reſolved to wait a few days, and watch 
the event. 


The ſtruggles of latent tenderneſs 
and 


( 189 } 


and aſſumed indifference, baniſhed tran- 
quillity from the boſom of Mary, and 
pierced it with many ſorrows. The 
friendſhip and honours beſtowed by the 
Earl on Alleyn, who now reſided ſolely 
at the caſtle, touched her heart with a 
{ſweet pride; but alas! theſe diſtincti- 
ons ſerved only to confirm her admira- 
tion-of that worth, which had already 
attached her affections, and afforded 
him opportunities of exhibiting, in 
brighter colours, the various excellen- 
cies of a heart noble and expanſive, and 
of a mind, whole native elegance melio- 
rated and adorned the bold vigour of its 
flights. The languor of melancholy, 
notwithſtanding the efforts of Mary, 
would at intervals ſteal from beneath the 
diſguiſe of cheerfulneſs, and diffuſe over 
her beautiful features an expreſſion ex- 
tremely intereſting. The ſtranger was 
not inſenſible to its charms, and it 
ſerved to heighten the admiration, with 
which he had firſt beheld her, into ſome-

thing more tender and more powerful. 
The modeſt dignity, with which ſhe de- 
hvered her ſentiments, which breathed 
the pureſt delicacy and benevolence, 
touched his heart, and he felt an intereſt 
concerning her, which he had n&amp;her be- 
fore experienced. 


Alleyn, whoſe heart amid the anxieties 


and tumults of the paſt ſcenes, had ſtill 
ſighed to the image of Mary ;—that 


image, which fancy had pictured in all 


the charms of the orignal, and whoſe 


glowing tints were yet ſoftened and ren-

voured to aſſume a cheerfulneſs foreign 
to his heart; but endeavoured in vain. 
Mary perceived the change in his 
manners; and the obſervation did not 
contribute to enliven her own. The 


Earl, too, obſerved that Alleyn had 


loſt much of his wonted ſpirits, and 
bantered him on the change, but thought 
not of his ſiſter. 


Alleyn wiſhed to quit a place ſo de- 
ſtructive to his peace as the caſtle of 
Athlin; he formed repeated reſolutions 
of withdrawing himſelf from thoſe walls, 
which held him in a ſort of faſcination, 
and rendered ineffectual every halt- 
formed wiſh, and every weak endea- 
vour. When he could no longer be- 
hold Mary, he would frequently retire 
to the terrace, which was overlooked by 


the windows of her apartment, and 
| ſpend half the night in traverſing, with 


filent, mournful ſteps, that ſpot, which 
afforded him the melancholy pleaſure 


of being near the object of his love.

Matilda wiſhed to queſtion Alleyn 
concerning ſome circumſtances of the 
late events, and for this purpoſe or- 
dered him one day to attend her in her 
cloſet. As he paſſed the outer apart- 
ment of the Counteſs, he perceived 
ſomething lying near the door, through 
which ſhe had before gone, and, examin- 
ing it, diſcovered a bracelet, to which 
wasattached a miniature of Mary. His 
heart beat quick at the ſight; the 
temptation was too powerful to be re- 
Hſted; he concealed it in his boſom, and 
paſſed on. On quitting the cloſet, he 
ſought, with breathleſs impatience, a ſpot, 
where he might contemplate at leiſure 
that precious portrait, which chance had 
ſo kindly thrown in his way. He drew 
it trembling from his boſom, and beheld 
again that countenance, whoſe ſweet ex- 
preſſion had touched his heart with all 
the delightful agonies of love. As he 
preſſed it with impaſſioned tenderneſs 
to his lips, the tear of rapture trembled 
in

ia his eye, and the romantic ardour of the 
moment was ſcarcely heightened by the 
actual preſence of the beloved object, 
whoſe light ſtep now ſtole upon his ear; 
and half turning he beheld not the 
picture, but the reality !—Surprized l 
--confuſed !—The picture fell from 
his hand. Mary, who had accidentally 


ſtrolled to that ſpot, on obſerving the 


agitation of Alleyn, was retiring, when 
he, in whoſe heart had been awakened 


every tender ſenſation, loſing in the 


temptation of the moment the fear of 


diſdain, and forgetting the reſolution 


which he had formed of eternal ſilence, 
threw himſelf at her feet, and preſſed 
her hand to his trembling lips. His 
tongue would have told her that he 
loved, but his emotion, and the repul- 
five look of Mary, prevented him. She 
inſtantly diſengaged herſelf with an air 
of offended dignity, and caſting on him 
a look of mingled anger and concern, 
withdrew in ſilence. Alleyn remained

fixed to the ſpot ; his eyes purſuing her 


retiring ſteps, inſenſible to every feeling 
but thoſe of love and deſpair. Po abſorbed 


was he in the tranſition of the moment, that 


he almoſt doubted whether a viſionary 


illuſion had not croſſed his fight to blaſt 


his only remaining comfort—the con- 


ſciouſneſs of deſerving, and of poſſeſſing 


the eſteem of her he loved. He left 
the place with anguiſh in his heart, 
and, in theperturbation of his mind, for- 
got the picture. 


Mary had obſerved her mother's 


bracelet fall from his hand, and was no 
longer in perplexity concerning her mi- 
niature; but in the confuſion which his 
behaviour occaſioned her, ſhe forgot to 
demand it of him. The Counteſs had 
miſſed it almoſt immediately after his 
departure from the cloſet, and had 


cauſed a ſearch to be made, which 


proving fruitleſs, her ſuſpicions wavered 


upon him. The Earl, who ſoon after 
paſſed

paſſed the ſpot whence Alleyn had juſt 
departed, found the miniature. It was 
not long ere Alleyn recollected the 
treaſure he had dropped, and returned 
in ſearch of it. Inſtead of the picture, 


he found the Earl: a conſcious bluſh 


croſſed his cheek; the confuſion of his 
countenance informed Oſbert of a part 
of the truth ; who, anxious to know by 
what means he had obtained it, pre- 
ſented him the picture, and demanded 
if he knew it. The ſoul of Alleyn 
knew not to diſſemble; he acknow- 
ledged that he had found, and concealed 
it; prompted by that paſſion, the con- 
feſſion of which, no other circumſtance 
than the preſent could have wrung from 
his heart. The Earl liſtened to him 
with a mixture of concern and pity ; 


but hereditary pride chilled the warm 


feelings of friendſhip and of gratitude, 
and extinguiſhed the faint ſpark of hope 
which the diſcovery had kindled in the 
boſom of Alleyn. © Fear not, my

Lord,” ſaid he, © the degradation of 
your houſe from one who would facri- 


fice his life in its defence; never more 


ſhall the paſſion which glows in my 
heart eſcape from my lips. I will re- 
tire from the ſpot where I have buried 
my tranquillity.” “ No,” replied the 
Earl, you ſhall remain here; I can 


confide in your honour. O! that the 


only reward which is adequate to your 
worth and to your ſervices, it ſhould be 
impoſſible for me to beſtow.” His 


voice faultered, and he turned away to 
conceal his emotion, with a ſuffering 


little inferior to that of Alleyn. 


The diſcovery which Mary had made, 
did not contribute to reſtore peace to 
her mind. Every circumſtance con- 
ſpired to aſſure her of that ardent paſſion 


which filled the boſom of him whom all 


her endeavours could not teach her to 
forget; and this conviction ſerved only 
to

quently her wretchedneſs. 


Tho intereſt which the ſtranger dif- 
covered, and the attention he paid to 
Mary, had not paſſed unobſerved by 
Alleyn. Love pointed to him the paſ- 
ſion which was riſing in his heart, and 
whiſpered that the vows of his rival 
would be propitiouss The words of 
Oſbert confirmed him in the torturing 
apprehenſion; for though his humble 
birth had never ſuffered him to hope, 
yet he thought he diſcovered in the 

ſpeech of the Earl, ſomething more 
than mere hereditary pride. 


The ſtranger had contemplated the 
lovely form of Mary with increaſing 
admiration, ſince the firſt hour he 
beheld her; this admiration was now 
confirmed into love; —and he re- 
ſolved to acquaint the Earl with his 
birth, and with his paſſion. For this

was true, were become invalid. 


'The Earl liſtened to this narrative in 
ſilent aſtoniſhment, and enquired, with 
much emotion, the name of the Count's 
relations. The Baroneſs Malcolm,” 
returned he. The Earl claſped his hands 
in extaſy. The Count, ſurprized at his 
agitation, began to fear that the Earl 
was diſagreeably intereſted in the welfare 
of his adverſaries, and regretted that he 
had diſcloſed the affair, till he obſerved 
the pleaſure which was diffuſed through 
his features. Oſbert explained the cauſe 
of his emotion, by relating his know- 
ledge of the Baroneſs; in the progreſs 
of whoſe ſtory, the character of Mal- 
colm was ſufficiently elucidated. He 
told the cauſe of his hatred towards 
the Baron, and the hiſtory of his im- 
priſonment; and alſo confided to his 


honour the ſecret of his challenge.

The indignation of the Count was 


ſtrongly excited; he was, however, 


prevailed on by Oſbert to forego any 
immediate effort of revenge, awaiting 


for awhile the movements of Malcolm. 


The Count was ſo abſorbed in won- 
der and in new ſenſations, that he had 


almoſt forgot the chief object of the in- 


terview. Recollecting himſelf, he diſ- 
covered his paſſion, and requeſted per- 
miſſion of the Earl to throw himſelf at 
the feet of Mary. The Earl liſtened to 


the declaration with a mixture of plea- 


ſure and concern; the remembrance of 


Alleyn ſaddened his mind; but the wiſh 
of an equal connection, made him wel- 


come the offers of the Count, whoſe alli- 


ance, he told him, would do honour to 
the firſt nobility of his nation. If he 
found the ſentiments of his ſiſter in 
ſympathy with his own on this point, 
he would welcome him to his family 


with the affection of a brother ; but he

heart, ere his noble friend diſcloſed to 


her his prepoſſeſſion. 


The Earl on his return to the caſtle 
enquired for Mary, whom he found in 


the apartment of her mother. He 


opened to them the hiſtory of the Count; 
his relationſhip with the Baroneſs Mal- 
colm, with the object of his expedition, 
and cloſed the narrative with diſcover- 
ing the attachment of his friend to 
Mary, and his offers of alliance with his 
family. Mary grew pale at this decla- 
ration; there was a pang in her heart 


which would not ſuffer her to ſpeak; 


ſhe threw her eyes on the ground, and 
burſt into tears. The Earl took her 
hand tenderly in his; My beloved 
ſiſter,“ ſaid he, © knows me too well to 
doubt my affection, or to ſuppoſe I can 
wiſh to influence her upon a ſubject ſo 
material to her future happineſs, and

pal dire&amp;reſs. Do me the juſtice to be- 
lieve, that I make known to you the 
ofters of the Count as a friend, not as a 
director. He is a man, who from the 
ſhort period of our acquaintance, I have 
judged to be deſerving of particular 
eſteem. His mind appears to be noble; 
his heart expanſive; his rank is equal 
with your own; and he loves you with 
an attachment warm and ſincere. But 
with all theſe advantages, I would not 
have my ſiſter give herſelf to the man 
who does not meet an intereſt in her 
heart to plead his cauſe.” 


The gentle ſoul of Mary ſwelled with 
gratitude towards her brother; ſhe 
would have thanked him for the ten- 
derneſs of theſe ſentiments, but a variety 
of emotions were ſtruggling at her 
heart, and ſuppreſſed her utterance; tears 
and a ſmile, ſoftly clouded with ſorrow, 
were all ſhe could give him in reply. 
He could not but perceive that ſome ſe- 

cred

cret cauſe of grief preyed upon her 
mind, and he ſolicited to know, and to 
remove it. My dear brother will 
believe the gratitude which his kind- 
neſs She would have finiſhed 
the ſentence, but the words died away 
upon her lips, and ſhe threw herſelf on 
the boſom of her mother, endeavouring to 
conceal her diſtreſs, and wept in ſilence. 
TheCounteſs too well underſtood the grief 
of her daughter ; ſhe had witneſſed the 
ſecret ſtruggles of her heart, which all 
her endeavours werenot able to overcome, 
and which rendered the offers of the 
Count diſguſting, and dreadful to her 
imagination. Matilda knew how to 
feel for her ſufferings; but the affection 
of the mother extended her views be- 
yond the preſent temporary evil, to the 
future welfare of her child; and in the 
long perſpective of ſucceeding years, ſhe 
beheld her united to the Count, whoſe

ſhe received the thanks of Mary for her 
gentle guidance to the good ſhe poſ- 
ſeſſed; the artleſs looks of the little 
ones around her, ſmiled their thanks; 
and the luxury of that ſcene recalled the 
memory of times for ever paſſed, and 


mingled with the tear of rapture the 


ſigh of fond regret. The ſureſt method 
of eraſing that impreſſion which threat- 
ened ſerious evil to the peace of her 
child if ſuffered to continue, and to 
ſecure her permanent felicity, was to 
unite her to the Count; whoſe amiable 
diſpoſition would ſoon win her affecti- 
ons, and obliterate from her heart every 
improper remembrance of Alleyn. She 


determined, therefore, to employ argu- 


ment and gentle perſuaſion, to guide 
her to her purpoſe. She knew the mind 
of Mary to be delicate and candid ; 
eaſy of conviction, and firm to purſue 
what her judgment approved; and ſhe 
did not deſpair of ſucceeding.

HE Count was walking on the 
ramparts of the caſtle, involved 
in thought, when Oſbert approached; 


Whoſe lingering ſtep and diſappointed 


air, ſpoke to his heart the rejection of 
his ſuit. He told the Count that Mary 
did not at prefent feel for him thoſe 
ſentiments of affection which would 
juſtify her in accepting his propoſals. 
This information, though it ſhocked 


the hopes of the Count, did not entirely 
deſtroy them; for he yet believed that 


time and aſſiduity might befriend his 
wiſhes, While theſe Noblemen were 
leaning on the walls of the caſtle, en- 
gaged in carneſt converſation, they ob- 
ſerved on a diſtant hill a cloud emerging 
from the verge of the horizon, whoſe 
duſky hue glittered with ſudden light;

in an inſtant they deſcried the glance of 
arms, and a troop of armed men poured 
in long ſucceſſion over the hill, and 
hurried down its ſide to the plains be- 
low. The Earl thought he recognized 
the clan of the Baron. It was the Baron 
himſelf who now advanced at the head 


of his people, in ſearch of that revenge 


which had been hitherto denied him; 
and who, determined on conqueſt, had 
brought with him an hoſt which he 
thought more than ſufficient to over- 
whelm the caſtle of his enemy. 


The meſſenger, who had been ſent 
with the challenge, had been detained a 
priſoner by Malcolm; who in the mean 
time, had haſtened his preparations to 
ſurprize the caſtle of Athlin. The de- 
tention of his ſervant had awakened 
the ſuſpicions of the Earl, and he had 
taken precautions to guard againſt the 
deſigns of his enemy. He had ſum- 


moned his clan to hold themſelves in 
readineſs 


f $19 3 


readineſs for a ſudden attack, and had 
prepared his caſtle for the worſt emer- 
gency. He now ſent a meſſenger to 
the clan with ſuch orders as he judged 
expedient, arranged his plans within the 
walls, and took his ſtation on the ram- 
parts to obſerve the moveme!its of his 
enemy. The Count, clad in arms, ſtood 
by his fide, Alleyn was poſted with a 
party within the great gate of the 
caſtle, 


The Baron advanced with his people, 
and quickly ſurrounded the walls. With- 
in all was ſilent; the caſtle ſeemed to 
repoſe in ſecurity; and the Baron, certain 
of victory, congratulated himſelf on the 
ſucceſs of the enterprize, when obſerv- 
ing the Earl, whoſe perſon was concealed 
in armour, he called to him to ſurrender 
himſelf and his Chief to the arms of 
Malcolm. - The Earl anſwered the ſum- 
mons with an arrow from his bow, 


which, miſſing the Baron, pierced one of

his attendants. The archers, who had been 
planted behind the walls, now diſcovered 
themſelves, and diſcharged a ſhower of 


arrows; at the ſame time every part of 


the caſtle appeared thronged with the 
ſoldiers of the Earl, who hurled on the 
heads of the aſtoniſhed beſiegers, lances 


and other miſſile weapons with unceaſing 


rapidity. The alarum bell now rung 
out the ſignal to that part of the clan 
without the walls, and they immedi. 
ately poured upon the enemy, who, 
confounded by this unexpected attack, 
had ſcarcely time to defend themſelves. 
The clang of arms reſounded through 
the air, with the ſhouts of the vidtors, 
and the groans of the dying. The fear 
of the Baron, which had principally 
operated on the minds of his people, 
was now overcome by ſurprize, and the 
fear of death; and on the firſt repulſe, 
they deſerted from the ranks in great 
numbers, and fled to the diſtant hills. 


In vain the Baron endeavoured to rally 
his 


E 


his ſoldiers, and keep them to the 
charge; they yielded to a ſtronger im- 
pulſe than the menaces of their Chief 
who was now left with leſs than half his 
numbers at the foot of the walls. The 
Baron, to whom cowardice was un- 
known, diſdaining to retreat, continued 
the attack. At length the gates of the 
caſtle were thrown open, and a party 
iſſued upon the aſſailants, headed by the 
Farl and the Count, who divided in 
queſt of Malcolm. The Count ſought 
in vain, and the ſearch of Oſbert was 
equally fruitleſs; their adverſary was 
no where to be found. Olbert, appre- 
henſi ve of his gaining admittance to the 
caſtle by ſtratagem, was returning in 
haſte to the gates, when he received the 
ſtroke of a ſword upon his ſhoulder ; 
his armour had broke the force of the 
blow, and the wound it had given was 
flight. He turned his ſword, and facing 
his enemy, diſcovered a foldier of Mal- 
colm's who attacked him with a deſpe- 

| rate 


im} 
rate courage. The encounter was fu- 
rious and long; dexterity and equal 
valour ſeemed to animate both the com- 
batants. Alleyn, who obſerved from 
his poſt the danger of the Earl, flew in- 
ſtantly to his aſſiſtance; but the criſis 
of the ſcene was paſt ere he arrived; 
the weapon of Oſbert had pierced the 
ſide of his adverſary, and he fell to the 
ground. The Earl diſarmed him, and 
holding over him his ſword, bade him 
aſk his life. © I have no life to aſk,” 
ſaid Malcolm, whoſe fainting voice the 
Earl now diſcovered, © if I had, *tis 


death only I would accept from you. 
O! curſed He would have 


' finiſhed the ſentence, but his wound 


flowed apace, and he fainted with loſs 
of blood. The Earl threw down his 
ſword, and calling a party of his people; 
he committed to them the care of the 
Baron, and ordered them to'proceed and 
ſeize the caſtle of Dunbayne. Under- 
ſtanding their Chief was mortally 

Vounded, 


( 214 ) 


wounded, the remains of Malcolm's 
army had fled from the walls. The peo- 
ple of the Earl proceeded without inter- 
ruption, and took poſſeſſion of the caſtle 
without oppoſition. 


The wounds of the Baron were 


examined when he reached Dunbayne, 
and a dubious ſentence of the event 


was pronounced. His countenance 
marked the powerful workings of 
his mind, which ſeemed labouring 
with an unknown evil; he threw his 
eyes eagerly round the apartment, as if 
in ſearch of ſome object which was not 
preſent. After ſeveral attempts to ſpeak, 
« Flatter me not,“ ſaid he, © with hopes 
of life; it is flitting faſt away; but 
while I have breath to ſpeak, let me ſee 
the Baroneſs.” She came, and hanging 
over his couch in ſilent horror, received 
his words: © I have injured you, 
Madam, I fear beyond reparation. In 
theſe laſt few moments let me endea- 


vour to relieve my conſcience by diſco- 
6 vering

vering to you my guilt and my re- 


morſe.” The Baroneſs ſtarted, fearful 


of the coming ſentence. * You had a 


| ſon.” © What of my ſon?* © You 
had a ſon, whom my boundleſs ambition 
doomed to exile from his parents and 
his heritage, and who I cauſed you to 
believe had died in your abſence.” 
« Where is my child?“ exclaimed the 
Baroneſs. I know not, reſumed 
Malcolm, © I committed him to the 


care of a man and woman who then 


lived on a remote part of my lands, but 
a few years after they diſappeared, and 
J have never heard of them ſince. The 
boy paſſed for a foundling whom I had 
ſaved from periſhing. One ſervant only

were impoſed upon. Thus far I tell 
you, Madam, to prompt you to enqui- 


ry, and to aſſuage the agonies of a bleed- 


ing conſcience. I have other deeds

more; ſhe was carried inſenſible from

the apartment. Laura, ſhocked at her 
condition, was informed of its cauſe, 
and filial tenderneſs watched over her 
with unwearied attention. 


In the mean time the Earl, on quit- 


ting Malcolm, had returned immediate- 
ly to the caſtle, and was the firſt meſſen- 


ger of that event which would probably 
avenge the memory of his father, and 
terminate the diſtreſſes of his family. 
The ſight of Oſbert, and the news he 
brought, revived the Counteſs and Ma- 
ry, who had retired during the aſſault 
into an inner apartment of the caſtle for 
greater ſecurity, and who had ſuffered, 
during that period all the terrors which 
their ſituation could inſpire. They 
were ſoon after joined by the Count and 
by Alleyn, whoſe conduct did not paſs 
unnoticed by the Earl. The cheek of 
Mary glowed at the relation of this 
new inſtance of his worth; and it 
was Alleyn's ſweet reward to obſerve 

her

her emotion. There was a ſentiment 
in the heart of Oſbert which ſtruggled 
againſt the pride of birth; he wiſhed to 
reward the ſervices and the noble ſpirit 
of the youth, with the virtues of Mary; 
but the authority of early prejudice 
ſilenced the grateful impulſe, and ſwept 
from his heart the characters of truth. 


The Earl, accompanied by * Count, 
now haſtened to the caſtle of Dunbayne, 
to cheer the Baroneſs and her daughter 
with their preſence. As they approached 
the caſtle, the ſtillneſs and deſolation of 
the ſcene beſpoke the ſituation of its 
lord; his people were entirely diſperſed, 
a few only of his centinels wandered 
before the eaſtern gate; who, having 
made no oppoſition, were ſuffered by 
the Earl's people to remain. Few of 
the Baron's people were to be ſeen; 
thoſe few were unarmed, and appeared 
the effigies of fallen greatneſs. As the 
Earl croſſed the platform, the remem- 


brance of the paſt crowded upon his

( $18 } 
mind. The agonies which he had there 
ſuffered, the image of death which 
glared upon his ſight, aggravated by 
the bitter and ignominious circum- 
ſtances which attended his fate; the 
figure of Malcolm, mighty in injuſtice, 
and cruel in power; whoſe counte- 
nance, ſmiling horribly in triumphant 
revenge, ſent to his heart the ſtroke of 
anguiſh;—each circumſtance of tor- 
ture aroſe to his imagination in the 
glowing colours of truth; he ſhuddered 
as he paſſed; and the contraſt of the 
preſent ſcene touched his heart with the 
moſt affecting ſentiments. He ſaw the 
innate and active power of juſtice, which 
pervades all the circumſtances even of 
this life ike vital principle, and ſhines 
through the obſcurity of human acti- 
ons to the virtuous, the pure ray of 


Heaven;—to the guilty, the deſtruc- 


tive glare of lightning. 


On enquiring for the Baroneſs, they 
| 4 | were 


'{( #89 } 


were told ſhe was in the apartment of 
Malcolm, whoſe moment of diſſolution 
was now approaching. The name of 
the Count was delivered to the Baroneſs, 
and overheard by the Baron, who deſired 
to ſee him. Louiſa went out to receive 
her noble relation with all the joy 
which a meeting ſo deſirable and ſo un- 
looked for, could inſpire. On ſeeing 
Oſbert, her tears flowed faſt; and ſhe 
thanked him for his generous care, in a 
manner that declared a deep ſenſe of his 
ſervices. Leaving him, ſhe conducted 
the Count to Malcolm, who lay on his 
couch ſurrounded with the {ſtillneſs and 
horrors of death. He raiſed his languid 
head, and diſcovered a countenance wild 
and terrific, whoſe ghaſtly aſpect was 
overſpread with the paleneſs of death. 
The beauteous Laura, overcome by the 
ſcene, hung like a drooping lily over 
his couch, dropping faſt her tears. 
My lord,” ſaid Malcolm, in a low 
rone, “ you ſee before you a wretch, 

L 2 anxious

anxious to relieve the agony of a guilty 
mind. My vices have deſtroyed the 
peace of this lady, have robbed her of 
a ſon—but ſhe will diſcloſe to you the 
ſecret guilt, which I have now no time 
to tell. I have for ſome years received, 
as you now well know, the income of 
thoſe foreign lands which are her due; 
as a {mall reparation for the injuries ſhe 
has ſuſtained, I bequeath to her all the 
poſſeſſions which I lawfully inherit, and 
reſign her into your protection. To 
aſk oblivion of the paſt of you, Madam, 
and of you, my Lord, is what I dare not 
do; yet it would be ſome conſolation 
to my departing ſpirit, to be aſſured of 
your forgiveneſs.” The Baroneſs was 
too much affected to reply but by a look 
of aſſent; the Count aſſured him of 
forgiveneſs, and beſought him to com- 
poſe his mind for his approaching fate. 
« Compoſure, my Lord, is not for me; 
my Life has been marked with vice, and 
my death with the bitterneſs of fruitleſs 

remorſe.

remorſe. I have underſtood virtue, but 


I have loved vice. I do not now lament 


that I am puniſhed, but that I have de- 
ſerved puniſhment.” The Baron ſunk 
on his couch, and in a few moments af- 
ter expired in a ſtrong ſigh. Thus ter- 
minated the life of a man, whoſe un- 
derſtanding might have reached the hap- 
pineſs of virtue, but whoſe actions diſ- 
played the features of vice. 


From this melancholy ſcene, the Ba- 


roneſs, with the Count and Laura, re- 


tired to her apartment, where the Earl 
awaited their return with anxious ſoli- 
citude. The ſternneſs of juſtice for a 


moment relaxed when he heard of Mal- 
colm's death; his heart would have 


ſighed with compaſſion, had not the re- 


membrance of his father croſſed his 
mind, and checked the impulſe. « I 
can now, Madam,” ſaid he, addreſſing 


the Baroneſs, © reſtore you a part of 


thoſe poſſeſſions which were once your 
| — Lord's, 


: Mom 


f on Þ 


Lord's, and which ought to have been 
the inheritance of your ſon ; this caſtle 
trom henceforth is your's; 1 reſign it to 
its lawful owner.” The Baroneſs was 
overcome with the remembrance of his 
ſervices, and could ſcarcely thank him 
but with her tears. The ſervant whom 
the Baron had mentioned as the confi- 
dant of his iniquities, was ſent for, and 
interrogated concerning the infant he 
had charge of. From him, however, 
little comfort was received; for he could 
only tell, that he had conveyed the 
child, by the orders of his maſter, to a 
cottage on the furtheft borders of his 
eſtates, where he had delivered it to the 
care of a woman, who there lived with 
her huſband. Theſe people received at 
the ſame time, a ſum of money for its 
ſupport, with a promiſe of future ſup- 
plies. For ſome years he had been 
punctual in the payment of the ſums 
entruſted to him by the Baron, but at 


length he yielded to the temptation of 
with.

with-holding them for his own uſe; and 


on enquiring for the people ſome years 
after, he found they were gone from the 
place. The conditions of the Ba- 
roneſs's pardon to the man, depended 
on his endeavours to repair the injury 
he had promoted, by a ſtrict ſearch for 
the people to whom he had committed 
her child. She now conſulted with her 
friends on the beſt means to be purſued 
in this buſineſs, and immediately ſent off 
meſſengers to different parts of the 
country to gather information. 


The Baroneſs was now releaſed from 
oppreſſion and impriſonment; ſhe was 
re-inſtated in her ancient poſſeſſions, to 


which were added all the hereditary 


lands of Malcolm, together with his 
perſonal fortune: ſhe was ſurrounded 
by thoſe whom ſhe moſt loved, and in 
the midſt of a people who loved her; 
yet the conſequence of the Baron's 


guilt had left in her heart one drop of 


L 4 gall 


( 224 ) 


gall which embittered each ſource of 


happineſs, and made her life melancholy 
and painful, 


The Count was now her viſitor; ſhe 
was much conſoled by his preſence; 
and Laura's hours were often enlivened 


by the converſation of the Earl, to whom 


her heart was tenderly attached, and 
whoſe frequent viſits to the caſtle, were 
devoted to love and her. 


The felicity of Matilda now appeared 
as perfect and as permanent as is conſiſt- 
ent with the nature of ſublunary beings. 
Juſtice was done to the memory of her 
Lord, and her beloved ſon was ſpared to 
bleſs the evening of her days. The father 
of Laura had ever been friendly to the 
houſe of Athlin, and her delicacy felt 
no repugnance to the union which 
Oſbert ſolicited. But her happineſs, 
whatever it might appear, was incom- 
plete; ſhe ſaw the ſettled melancholy of

Mary, for love ſtill corroded her heart, 
and notwithſtanding her efforts, ſhaded 
her countenance. The Counteſs wiſhed 


to produce thoſe nuptials with the Count, 
which ſhe thought would re-eſtabliſh 


the peace of her child, and inſure her 
future felicity. She omitted no oppor- 
tunity of preſſing his ſuit, which ſhe 
managed with a delicacy that rendered 
it leſs painful to Mary; whoſe words, 
however, were few in reply, and who 
could ſeldom bear the ſubject to be long 


continued. Her ſettled averſion to the 


addreſſes of the Count, at length baffled 
the expectations of Matilda, and ſhewed 
her the fallacy of her efforts. She 
thought it improper to ſuffer the Count 
any longer to nouriſh in his heart a vain 
hope; and ſhe reluctantly commiſſioned 
the Earl to undeceive him on this 
point.

her ſon; the people with whom he had 
been placed where nowhere to be found, 
and no track was diſcovered which 
might lead to the truth. The diſtreſs 
of the Baroneſs can only be imagined; 
ſhe reſigned herſelf, in calm deſpair, to 
mourn in ſilence the eaſy confidence 
which had entruſted her child to the care 
of thoſe who had betrayed him. Though 
happineſs was denied her, ſhe was un- 
willing to with-hold it from thoſe whom 
it awaited; and at length yielded to 
the entreaties of the Earl, and became 
his advocate with Laura, for the nup- 
tials which were to unite their fate, 


The Earl introduced the Counteſs _ 
and Mary to the caſtle of Dunbayne. 
Similarity of ſentiment and diſpoſition 
united Matilda and the Baroneſs in a 
laſting friendſhip. Mary and Laura 
were not leſs pleaſed with each other. 
The dejection of the Count at fight of 
Mary, declared the ardor of his paſſion, 

and 


1 
and would have awakened in her breaſt 
ſomething more than compaſſion, had 
not her heart been pre- occupied. Al- 
leyn, who could think of Mary only, 
wandered through the caſtle of Athlin a 
ſolitary being, who fondly haunts the 
ſpot where his happineſs lies buried. 
His prudence formed reſolutions, which 
his paſſion as quickly broke; and cheat- 
ed by love, though followed by deipair, 
he delayed his departure from day to 
day, and the illuſion of yeſterday conti- 
nued to be the illuſion of the morrow. 
The Earl, attached to his virtues, and 
grateful for his ſervices, would have 
beſtowed on him every honour but that 
alone which could give him happineſs, 
and which his pride would have ſuffered 
him to accept. Yet the honours which 
he refuſed—he refuſed with a grace ſo 
modeſt, as to conciliate kindneſs rather 


than wound generoſity. 


In a gallery on the North ſide of the 
| L 6- caſtle, 


( 

caſtle, which was filled with pictures of 
the family, hung a portrait of Mary. 
She was drawn in the dreſs which ſhe 
wore on the day of the feſtival, when 
ſhe was led by the Earl into the hall, 
and preſented as the partner of Alleyn. 
The likeneſs was ſtriking, and expreſ- 
ſive of all the winning grace of the ori- 
ginal. As often as Alleyn could ſteal 
from obſervation, he retired to this gal- 
lery, to contemplate the portrait of her 
who was ever preſent» to his imagina- 
tion: here he could breathe that figh 
which her preſence reſtrained, and ſhed 
thoſe tears which her preſence forbade 
to flow. As he ſtood one day in this 
place, wrapt in melancholy muſing, his 
ear was ſtruck with the notes of ſweet 
maſic ; they ſeemed to iſſue from the 
bottom of the gallery. The inſtrument 
was touched with an exquiſite expreſ- 
ſion, and in a voice whoſe tones floated 
on the air in ſoft undulations, he diſtin- 
guiſhed the following words, which he 

remembered 


| ( 229 } 


remembered to be an ode compoſed' by 
the Earl, and preſented to Mary, who 
had ſet it to muſic the day before. 


MORNING, 


Darkneſs! thro' thy chilling glooms, . 
Weakly trembles twilight grey ; 

Twilight fades—and Morning comes, 
And: melts thy ſhadows ſwift away! 


She comes in her ztherial car, 
Involv'd in many a varying hue ; 

And thro' the azure ſhoots afar, 
Spirit—light—and life anew !. 


Her breath revives the drooping flowers,. 
Her ray diſſolves the dews of night; 
Recalls the ſprightly-moving hours, 
And the green ſcene unveils in light! 


Her's the freſh gale that wanders wild 
O'er mountain top, and dewy glade ; 

And fondly ſteals the breath, beguil'd, 
Of ev'ry flow'r in ey'ry ſhade, 


Mother 


( 00 J 
Mother of Roſes—bright Aurora!—hail! 
Thee ſhall the cborus of the hours ſalute, 
And ſong of early birds from ev'ry vale, 
And blithſome horn, and fragrant zephyr mute! 


And oft as riſing o'er the plain, | 
Thou and thy roſcate Nymphs appear, 
This ſimple ſong in choral ſtrain, 
From rapturing Bards ſhall meet thine ear, 


CHORUS, 


Dance ye lightly—lightly on! 
Tis the bold lark thro' the air, 

Hails your beauties with his ſong; 
Lightly—lightly fleeting fair! 


Entranced in the ſweet ſounds, he 
had proceeded ſome ſteps down the 
gallery, when the muſic ceaſed. He 
ſtopped. After a ſhort pauſe it re- 
turned, and as he advanced he diſtin- 
guiſhed theſe words, ſung in a low voice 
mournfully ſweet : 


"a. 


8 In ſolitude I mourn thy reign, 
4 Ah! youth beloy'd—but lov'd in vain! 


FY 3 
* „ 


CF nn yi 


The voice was broken and loſt in 
ſobs ; the chords of the lute were wildly 
ſtruck: and in a few moments ſilence 
enſued. He ſtepped on towards the 
ſpot whence the ſounds had proceeded, 
and through a door which was left open, 
he diſcovered Mary hanging over her 
lute diſſolved in tears. He ſtood for 
ſome moments abſorbed in mute admi- 
ration, and unobſerved by Mary, who 
was loſt in her tears, till a ſigh which 
eſcaped him, recalled her to reality ; ſhe 
raiſed her eyes, and beheld the object 
of her ſecret ſorrows. She aroſe in con- 
fuſion; the bluſh on her cheek betrayed 
her heart; ſhe was retiring in haſte from 
Alleyn, who remained at the entrance 
of the room the ftatue of deſpair, when 
ſhe was intercepted by the Earl, who 
entered by the door ſhe was opening; 
her eyes were red with weeping; he 
glanced on her a look of ſurprize and 
diſpleaſure, and paſſed on to the gallery 
followed by Alleyn, who was now awak- 
enced 


( 232 ) 
ened from his trance. From: you, 
Alleyn,” ſaid the Earl, in a tone of diſ- 
pleaſure, © I expected other conduct; 
on your word I relied, and your word 
has deceived me.” „Hear me, my 
Lord,” returned the youth, © your 
confidence I have never abuſed; hear 
me.” ©] have now no time for parley,”” 
replied Oſbert, my moments are pre- 
cious; {ome future hour of leiſure may 
ſuffice.” So ſaying, he walked away 
with an abrupt haughtineſs, which 
touched the ſoul of Alleyn, who diſ- 
dained to purſue him with further ex- 
planation. He was now completely 


wretched. The ſame accident which 


had unveiled to him the heart of Mary, 
and the full extent of that happineſs 
which fate with-held, confirmed him in 
deſpair. The ſame accident had ex- 
poſed the delicacy of her he loved to a 
cruel ſhock, and had ſubjected his ho- 
nour to ſuſpicion; and to a ſevere re- 
buke from him, by whom it was his 
pride 


Xa 
pride to be reſpected, and for whoſe 


ſafety he had ſuffered impriſonment, and 
encountered death. 


Mary had quitted the cloſet diſtreſſed 
and perplexed. She perceived the miſ- 
take of the Earl, and it ſhocked her. 
She wiſhed to undeceive him; but he 
was gone to the caſtle of Dunbayne, to 
pay one of thoſe viſits which were ſoon 
to conclude in the nuptials, and whence 
he did not return till evening. The 
ſcene which he had witneſled in the 
morning, involved him in tumult of 


diſtreſs. He conſidered the mutual paſ- 


ſion which filled the boſom of his ſiſter 
and Alleyn; he had ſurprized them in a 
ſolitary apartment; he had obſerved 
the tender and melancholy air of Alleyn, 
and the tears and confuſion of Mary; 
and he at firſt did not hefitate to believe 
that the interview had been appointed. In 
the heat of his diſpleaſure he had reject- 
cd the explanation of Alleyn with a 

haughty

naughty reſentment, which the late ſcene 
alone could have excited, and which the 
deluſion it had occaſioned alone could 
excuſe. Cooler conſideration, however, 
brought to his mind the delicacy and the 


amiable pride of Mary, and the integrity 


of Alleyn; and he accuſed himſelf of a 
too haſty deciſion. The zealous ſervices 
of Alleyn came to his heart; he repented 
that he had treated him ſo rigorouſly ; 
and on his return enquired for him, that 
he might hear an explanation, and that 
he might ſoften the pany of his for- 
mer behaviour.

CHAPTER: Ak 


' A LLEYN was no where to be 
41 found. The Earl went himſelf in 

queſt of him, but without ſucceſs. As 
he returned from the terrace, chagrined 
and difappointed, he obſerved two per- 
fons croſs the platform at fome diſtance 
before him; and he could perceive by 
the dim moon-light which fell upon the 
ſpot, that they were not of the caſtle; 
He called to them: no anſwer was re- 
turned; but at the ſound of his voice 
they quickened their pace, and almoft 
inſtantly diſappeared in the darkneſs of 
the ramparts. Surprized at this phœ- 
nomenon, the Earl followed with haſty 
ſteps, and endeavoured to purſue the 
way they had taken. He walked on 
ſilently, but there was no ſound to di- 


rect 


( as 7 | 
rect his ſteps. When he came to the 


extremity of the rampart, which formed 
the North angle of the caſtle, he ſtoppe&amp; 
to examine the ſpot, and to liſten if any 
thing was ſtirring. No perſon was to be 
ſeen, and all was huſhed. After he had 
ſtood ſome time ſurveying the rampart, 
he heard the low reſtrained voice of a 
perſon unknown, but the diſtance pre- 
vented his diſtinguiſhing the ſubje&amp; of 
the converſation. The voice ſeemed to 
approach the place where he ſtood. He 
drew his ſword, and watched in filence 
their motions. They continued to ad- 
vance, till, ſuddenly ſtopping, they 
turned, and took a long ſurvey of the 
fabric. Their diſcourſe was conducted 
in a low tone; but the Earl could diſ- 
cover by the vehemence of their geſture, 
and the caution of their ſteps, that they 
were upon ſome deſign dangerous to the 
peace of the caſtle. Having finiſhed 
their examination, they turned again to- 
wards the place where the Earl ſtill re- 
mained; 


; 


l 


mained; the ſhade of a high turret con- 
cealed him from their view, and they 
continued to approach till they arri ved 
within a ſhort ſpace of him, when they 
turned through a ruined arch-way of 

the caſtle, and were loſt in the dark re- 
ceſſes of the pile. Aſtoniſhed at what he 
had ſeen, Oſbert haſtened to the caſtle, 
Vhence he diſpatched ſome of his peo- 
ple in ſearch of the unknown fugitives; 
he accompanied ſome of his domeſtics 
to the ſpot where they had laſt diſap- 
peared. They entered the arch-way, 
which led to a decayed part of the caſ- 
tle; they followed over broken pave- 
ment the remains of a paſſage, which was 
cloſed by a low obſcure door almoſt 
concealed from ſight by the thick ivy 
which overſhadowed it. On opening 
this door, they deſcended a flight of 
ſteps which led under the caſtle, ſo ex- 
tremely narrow and broken as to make 
the deſcent both difficult and dangerous. 
The powerful damps of long pent-up 


vapours 


( 23F JN 


vapours extinguiſhed their light, and 
the Earl and his attendants were com- 
pelled to remain in utter darkneſs, 
while one of them went round to the 
habitable 'part of the caſtle to relume 
the lamp. While they awaited in filence 
the return of light, a ſhort breathing 
was diſtinctly heard at intervals, near the 
place where they ſtood. The ſervants 
ſhook with fear, and the Earl was not 
wholly unmoved. They remained en- 
tirely ſilent, liſtening its return, when a 
ſound of footſteps ſlowly ftealing 
through the vault, ſtartled them. The 
Earl demanded who paſſed ;—he was 
anſwered only by the deep echoes of his 
voice. They claſhed their ſwords and 
had advanced, when the ſteps haſtily 
retired before them. The Earl ruſhed 
forward, purſuing the ſound, till over- 
taking the perſon who fled, he ſeized 
him; a ſhort ſcuffle enſued; the ſtrength 
of Oſbert was too powerful for his anta- 
goniſt, who was nearly overcome, when 

| the 


( 239 ) 


the point of a ſword from an unknown 
hand pierced his ſide, he relinquiſh- 
ed his graſp, and fell to the ground. 
His domeſtics, whom the activity .of 
their maſter had outran, now came up; 
but the aſſaſſins, whoever they were, 
had. accompliſhed their eſcape, for the 
ſound of their ſteps was quickly loſt in 
the diſtance of the vaults. They endea- 
voured to raiſe the Earb who lay ſpeech- 
leſs on the ground; but they knew not 
how to convey him from that place of 
horror, for they were yet in total dark- 
neſs, and unacquainted with the place. 
In this ſituation, every moment of delay 
appeared an age. Some of them tried 
to find their way to the entrance, but 
their efforts were defeated by the dark- 
neſs, and the ruinous ſituation of the 
place. The light at length appeared, 
and diſcovered the Earl inſenſible, and 
weltering in his blood. He was con- 
veyed into the caſtle, where the horror 
of the Counteſs on ſeeing him borne in- 


to 


( 240 ) 


to the hall, may be eaſily imagined. 
By the help of proper applications he 
was reſtored to life; his wound was ex- 
amined, and found to be dangerous; and 
he was carried to bed in a ſtate which 
gave very faint hopes of recovery. The 
aſtoniſhment of the Counteſs, on hearing 
the adventure, was equalled only by her 
diſtreſs. All her conjectures concern- 
ing the deſigns, and the identity of the 
aſſaſſin, were vague and uncertain. She 
knew not on whom to fix the ſtigma; 
nor could diſcover any means by which 
to penetrate this myſterious affair. The 
people who had remained in the vaults 
to purſue the ſearch, now returned to 
Matilda. Every receſs of the caſtle, and 
every part of the ramparts, had been 
explored, yet no one could be found; 
and the myſtery of the proceeding was 
heightened by the manner in which the 
men had effected their eſcape. 


Mary watched over her brother in 
ſilent 


( 241 ) 

ſilent anguiſh, yet ſhe ſtrove to conceal 
her diſtreſs, that ſhe might encourage 
the Counteſs to hope. The Counteſs 
endeavoured to reſign herſelf to the 
event with a kind of deſperate fortitude. 
There is a certain point of miſery, be- 
yond which the mind becomes callous, 
and acquires a ſort of artificial calm. 
Exceſs of miſery may be ſaid to blaſt 
the vital powers of feeling, and by a 
natural conſequence conſumes its own 
principle. Thus it was with Matilda ; 
a long ſucceſſion of trials had reduced 
her to a ſtate of horrid tranquillity, 
which followed the firſt ſhock of the 
preſent event. It was not ſo with Lau- 
ra; young in misfortune, and gay in 
hope, ſhe ſaw happineſs fade from her 
graſp, with a warmth of feeling un- 
touched by the chill of diſappointment. 
When the news of the Earl's ſituation 
reached, her, ſhe was overcome with 
affliction, and pined in filent anguiſh. 
The Count haſtened to Olſbert, but grief

{at heavy at his heart, and he had no 


power to offer to others the comfort 
which he wanted himſelf. 


A fever, which was the conſequence 
of his wounds, added to the danger of 
the Earl, and to the deſpair of his fa- 
mily. During this period, Alleyn had 
not been ſeen at the caſtle; and his ab- 
ſence at this time, raiſed in Mary a va- 
riety of diſtreſſing apprehenſions. Of- 
bert enquired for him, and wiſhed to ſee 
him. The ſervant who had been ſent 
to his father's cottage, brought word 
that it was ſome days ſince he had been 
there, and that nobody knew whither he 
was gone, The ſurprize was univerſal ; 
but the effect it produced was various 
and oppoute. A collection of ſtrange and 
concomitant circumſtances, now forced 


a ſuſpicion on the mind of the Countels, 


which her heart, and her remembrance _ 


of the former conduct of Alleyn, at 
once 


( 2430 


once condemned. She had heard of 
what paſſed between the Earl and him in 
the gallery; his immediate abſence; the 
event which followed, and his ſubſe- 
quent flight, formed a chain of evidence 
which compelled her, with the utmoſt 
reluctance, to believe him concerned in 
the affair which had once more involved 
her houſe in raiſery. Mary had too 
much confidence in her knowledge of 
his character, to admit a ſuſpicion of 
this nature. She rejected, with inſtant 
diſdain, the idea of uniting Alleyn with 
diſhonour ; and that he ſhould be guilty 
of an action ſo baſe as the preſent, ſoared 
beyond all the bounds of poſſibility. 
Yet ſhe felt a ſtrange ſolicitude concern- 
ing him, and apprehenſion for his ſafe- 
ty tormented her inceſſantly. The an- 
guiſh in which he had quitted the apart- 
ment, her brother's injurious treatment, 
and his conſequent abſence, all conſpired 
to make her fear that deſpair had driven 

M 2 him 


CC # } 
him to commit ſome act of violence on 
himſelf. | 


The Earl, in the delirium of the 
fever, raved continually of Laura and 
of Alleyn; they were the ſole ſubjects of 
his ramblings. Seizing one day the 
hand of Mary, who ſat mournfully by 
his bed-ſide, and looking for ſome time 
penſively in her face, © weep not, my 
Laura,” ſaid he, © Malcolm, nor all the 
powers on earth ſhall tear you from 
me; his walls — his guards what 
are they? I'll wreſt you from his hold, 
or periſh. I have a friend whoſe valour 
will do much for us;—a friend—O ! 
name him not; theſe are ſtrange times; 
beware of truſting. I could have given 
him my very life—but not—1 will 
not name him.” Then Karting to the 
other ſide of the bed, and looking 
earneſtly towards the door with an ex- 


preſſion of ſorrow not to be deſcribed, 
'"* mot 


(. 245 ) 

* not all the miſeries which my worſt 
enemy has heaped upon me; not all the 
horrors of impriſonment and death, have 
ever touched my ſoul with a ſting ſo 
ſharp as thy unfaithfulneſs.” Mary 
was ſo much ſhocked by this fcene, that 
ſhe left the room and retired to her own 
apartment to indulge the agony of grief 
it occaſioned. 


The ſituation of the Earl grew daily 
more alarming; and the fever, which had 
not yet reached its criſis, kept the hopes 
and fears of his family ſuſpended, In one 
of his lucid intervals, addreſſing himſelf 
to the Counteſs in the moſt pathetic 
manner, he requeſted, that as death 


might probably ſoon ſeparate him for 


ever from her he moſt loved, he might 
ſee Laura once again before he died. She 
came, and weeping over him, a ſcene of 
anguiſh enſued too poignant for deſcrip- 


tion. He gave her his laſt vows; ſhe 
M 3 took 


( as } 


took of him a laſt look; and with a 
breaking heart tearing herſeli away, was 
carried to Dunbayne in a ſtate of danger 
little inferior to his. 


The agitatation he had ſuffered during 
this interview, cauſed a return of phren- 
zy more violent than any fit he had yet 
{uffered; exhauſted by it, he at length 
ſunk into a fleep, which continued with- 
out interruption for near four and twenty 
hours. During this time his repoſe 
was quiet and profound, and afforded 
the Counteſs and Mary, who watched 
over him alternately, the conſolations 
of hope. When he awoke he was per- 
fectly ſenſible, and in a very altered 
ſtate from that he had been in a few 
hours before. The criſis of the diſor- 
der was now paſt, and from that time it 
rapidly declined till he was reſtored to 
perfect health, 


The 


(- 247 ) 


The joy of Laura, whoſe health gra- 
dually returned with returning peace, 
and that of his family, was ſuch as the 
merits of the Earl deſerved. This joy, 
however, ſuffered a ſhort interruption 
from the Count of Santmorin, who, en- 
tering one morning the apartment of 
the Baroneſs, with letters in his hand, 
came to acquaint her that he had juſt 
received news of the death of a diſtant 
relation, who had bequeathed him ſome 
eſtates of value, to which it was neceſ- 
fary he ſhould immediately lay claim; 
and that he was, therefore, obliged, how- 
ever reluctantly, to ſer off for Switzer- 
land without delay. Though the Ba- 
roneſs rejoiced with all his friends, at 
his good fortune, ſhe regretted, u ith 
them, the neceſſity of his abrupt depar- 
ture. He took leave of them, and par- 
ticularly of Mary, for whom his paſſion 
was ſtill the ſame, with much emotion; 

and it was ſome time ere the ſpace he 


M4 had 


B 


had left in their ſociety was filled up, 
and ere they reſumed their wonted 


cheerfulneſs. 


Preparations were now making for 
the approaching nuptials, and the day 
of their celebration was at length fixed. 
The ceremony was to be performed 
in a chapel belonging to the caſtle of 
Dunbayne, by the chaplain of the Ba- 
roneſs. Mary only was to attend as 
bride-maid; and the Counteſs alſo, 
with the Baroneſs, was to be preſent. 
The abſence of the Count was uni- 
verſally regretted ; for from his hand 
the Earl was to have received his bride. 
The office was now to be ſupplied by 
a neighbouring Laird, whom the fa- 
mily of the Baroneſs had long eſteemed. 
At the earneſt requeſt of Laura, Mary 
conſented to ſpend the night preceding 
the day of marriage, at the caſtle of 


Dunbayne. The day ſo long and ſo 
anxiouſly 


( 249 ) 


anxiouſly expected by the Earl, at 
length arrived. The morning was ex- 
tremely fine, and the joy which glowed 
in his heart ſeemed to give additional 
ſplendor to the ſcene around him. He ſet 
off, accompanied by the Counteſs, for the 
caſtle of Dunbayne. He anticipated 
the joy with which he ſhould ſoon re- 
trace the way he then travelled, with 
Laura by his ſide, whom death alone 
could then ſeparate from him. On 
their arrival they were received by 
the Baroneſs, who enquired for Mary ; 
and the Counteſs and Otbert were 
thrown into the utmoſt coniternation, 
when they learned that ſhe had not been 
feen at the caſtle, The nuptials were 
again deferred; the caſtle was a fcene 
of univerſal confuſion. The Earl re- 
turned home inſtantly to diſpatch his 
people in ſearch of Mary. On en- 
quiry, he learned that the ſervants 
who had attended her, had not been 

NC heard 


( 250 ) 

heard of ſince their departure with 
their lady. Still more alarmed by 
this intelligence he rode himſelf in 
purſuit, yet not knewing which courſe 
to take. Several days were employed 


in a fruitleſs ſearch; no footſtep of her 
flight could be traced.

ARY, in the mean time, ſuffered 

all the terror which her ſituation 

could excite. On her way to Dun- 
bayne, ſhe had been overtaken by a 
party of armed men, who ſeized her 
bridle, and after engaging her ſervants 
in a feigned reſiſtance, carried her off 
ſenſeleſs. On recovering, ſhe found her- 
ſelf travelling through a foreſt, whoſe 
glooms were deepened by the ſhades of 
night. The moon, which was now up, 
glancing through the trees, ſerved to 
ſhew the dreary aſpett of the place, and 
the number of men who ſurrounded her; 
and ſhe was ſeized with a terror that al- 
moſt deprived her of reaſon. They 
travelled all night, during which a pro- 
found filence was obſerved. At the 
dawn of day ſhe found herſelf on the 
* ſkirts 


„ 

ſkirts of a heath, to whoſe wide deſola- 
tion her eye could diſcover no limits. 
Before they entered on the waſte, they 
halted at the entrance of a cave, formed 
in a rock, which was overhung with 
pine and fir; where, ſpreading their 
breakfaſt on the graſs, they offered re- 
freſhments to Mary, whoſe mind was 
too much diſtracted to ſuffer her to par- 
take of them. She implored them in the 
moſt moving accents, to tell her from 
whom they came, and whither they 
were carrying her; but they were in- 
ſenſible to her tears and her entreaties 
and ſhe was compelled to await, in ſilent 
terror, the extremity of her fate. They 
purſued their journey over the wilds, 
and towards the cloſe of day approached 
the ruins of an abbey, whoſe broken 
arches and lonely towers aroſe in 
gloomy grandeur through the obſcurity 
of evening. It ſtood the ſolitary inha- 
bitant of the waſte, —a monument of 
mortality and of ancient ſuperſtition, 

b and 


(263 ) 
and the frowning majeſty of its aſpect 
ſeemed to command filence and vene- 
ration. The chilly dews fell thick, and 
Mary, fatigued in body, and haraſſed 
in mind, lay almoſt expiring on her 
horſe, when they ſtopped under an arch 
of the ruin. She was not ſo ill as to be 
inſenſible to the objects around her; 
the awful ſolitude of the place, and the 
ſolemn aſpect of the fabric, whoſe effect 
was heightened by the falling glooms 
of evening, chilled her heart with hor- 
ror; and when they took her from the 
horſe, ſhe ſhrieked in the agonies of a 
laſt deſpair. They bore her over looſe 
{tones to a part of the building, which 
had been formerly the cloiſters of the 
abbey, but which was now fallen to 
decay, and overgrown with ivy. There 
was, however, at the extremity of theſe 
cloiſters a nook, which had withſtood 
with hardier ſtrength the ravages of 
time; the roof was here entire, and the 
ſhattered ſtanchions of the caſements

ſtill remained. Hither they carried 
Mary, and laid her almoſt lifeleſs on the 
graſſy pavement, while ſome of the ruf- 
fians haſtened to light a fire of the 
heath and ſticks they could pick up. 
They took out their proviſions, and 
placed themſelves round the fire, where 
they had not long been ſeated, when 
the ſound of diſtant thunder foretold 
an approaching ſtorm. . A violent ſtorm, 
accompanied with peals which ſhook 

the pile, came on. They were ſhel- 
tered from the heavineſs of the rain; 
but the long and vivid flaſhes of light- 
ning which glanced through the caſe- 
ments, alarmed them all. The ſhrieks 
of Mary were loud and continued ; 
and the fears of the rufhans did not pre- 
vent their uttering dreadful impreca- 
tions at her diſtreſs. One of them, in 
the fury of his reſentment, ſwore ſhe 
ſhould be gagged; and ſeizing her re- 
ſiſtleſs hands to execute the purpoſe, 
her cries redoubled. The ſervants who 
| had 


C 255 ) 


had betrayed her, were not yet ſo en- 
tirely loſt to the feelings of humanity, 
as to ſtand regardleſs of her preſent diſ- 
treſs; though they could not reſiſt the 
temptations of a bribe, they were un- 
willing their lady ſhould be loaded with 
unneceſſary miſery. They oppoſed the 
ruffians; a diſpute enſued; and the 
violence of the conteſt aroſe ſo high, 
that they determined to fight for the 
deciſion. Amid the peals of thunder, 
the oaths and execrations of the com- 
batants, added terror to the ſcene. The 
ſtrength of the ruffians were ſuperior to 
that of their opponents; and Mary, be- 
holding victory deciding againſt herſelf, 
uttered a loud ſcream, when the atten- 
tion of the whole party was ſurprized 
by the ſound of a footſtep in the cloiſter 
Immediately after a man ruſhed into 
the place, and drawing his ſword, de- 
manded the cauſe of the tumult. Mary, 
who lay almoſt expiring on the ground, 


now raiſed her eyes; but what were 
| her 


BE Te 7 ; 
her ſenſations, when ſhe raiſed them to 


Alleyn !—who now ſtood before her 
petrified with horror. Before he could 


fly to her aſſiſtance, the attacks of the 


ruffians obliged him to defend himſelf; 
he parried their blows for ſome time, 
but he muſt inevitably have yielded to 
the force of numbers, had not the 
trampling of feet, which faſt approach- 
ed, called off for a moment their atten- 
tion. In an inſtant the place was filled 
with men. The aſtoniſhment of Alleyn 
was, if poſſible, now encreaſed; for the 
Earl, followed by a party, now en- 
tered. The Earl, when he perceived 
Alleyn, ſtood at the entrance, aghaſt ! 
But reſuming his firmneſs, he bade 
him defend himſelf, The loud voice 
of Oſbert re-called Mary, and obſerving 
their menacing attitudes, ſhe collected 
juſt ſtrengrh ſufficient to throw herſelf 
between them. Alleyn dropped his 
ſword, and raiſed her from the ground; 
when the Earl rudely puſhed him away,

and ſnatched her to his heart. Hear 
me, Oſbert,” was all ſhe could fay. 
« Declare who brought her hither,”

thoſe men whom your people have ſe- 


cured. If my life is hateful .to you, 
ſtrike! and ſpare me the anguiſh of de- 
fending it againſt the brother of Mary.”

Mary ; the ſmall remains of her ſtrength

forſook her, and ſhe ſunk on the pave- 
ment. The Earl ſtarted a few ſteps 
back, and ſtood ſuſpended in wonder, 
The looks of the whole group defy 
deſcription. © Take a ſword,” ſaid the 
Earl, recovering himfelf, © and defend 
your life.” © Never, my lord, never! 
Though I have been hurried by the 
force of paſſion to rob you of a ſiſter, 
I will not aggravate my guilt by the 
murder of the brother. Your life has 
already been once endangered through 
my means, though not by my deſign; 
Heaven knows the anguiſh which that 
accident coſt me. The impetuoſity of 
paſſion impelled me onward with irre- 
ſiſtible fury; it urged me to violate the 
ſacred duties of gratitude—of friend- 
ſhip—and of humanity. To live in 
ſhame, and in the conſciouſneſs of guilt, 
is a living death. With your {word do 
- juſtice to yourſelf and virtue; and ſpare 
me the miſery of long comparing what 
I am, with what I was.” © Away—

fuſal. © And you, villain,” ſaid Oſbert, 
turning to the man who had confeſſed 
the plot, &amp; you pretended ignorance of 
the preſence of the Count; your per- 
fidy ſhall be rewarded.” © As I now

paſſion, when your people ſuprized and 


took me.” Mary confirmed the teſti- 
mony of the Count, by declaring that 


ſhe had not till that moment ſeen him

She pleaded for his life, and alſo for the 
ſervants, who had oppoſed the cruelty |

equality with vice?” ſaid the Count, 
« No, my hon, plunge your 
ſword in my heart, and expiate my 
guilt,” The Earl ſtill urged him to 
defence; and the Count ſtill perſiſted 
in refuſal. Touched by the recollection 
of paſt friendſhip, and grieved that a 
ſoul like the Count's ſhould ever be 
under the dominion of vice, Oſbert 
threw down his ſword, and, overcome 
with a ſort of tenderneſs—© Go, my 
lord, your perſon is ſafe; and if it is 
neceſſary to your peace, — ſtretching 
forth his hand, —take my forgiveneſs.” 
The Count, overcome by his generoſity, 
and by a ſenſe of his own unworthineſs, 
ſhrunk back: © Forbear, my lord, to 
wound by your goodneſs, a mind alrea- 
dy too ſenſible of its own debaſement; 
nor excite, by your generolity, a remorſe 
too keen to be endured. Your re- 
proaches I can bear,—your vengeance 
I ſolicit —but your kindneſs inflicts 
a torture too exquiſite tor my ſoul.” 
« Never, my Lord,” continued he, the

big tear ſwelling in his eye, —“ never 
more ſhall your friendſhip be polluted 
by my unworthineſs. Since you will 
not ſatisfy juſtice, by taking my life, I 
go to loſe it in the obſcurity of diſtant 
regions. Yet, ere I go, ſuffer me to 
make one laſt requeſt to you, and to that 
dear lady whom I have thus injured, 
and on whom my eyes now gaze for the 
laſt time, — ſuffer me to hope that you 
will blot from your memory the exiſt- 
ence of Santmorin.”** He concluded the 
ſentence with a groan, which vibrated 
upon the hearts of all preſent; and 
without waiting for a reply, hurried 
from the ſcene. The Earl had turned 
away his head in pity, and when he 
again looked round to reply, perceived 
that the Count was departed ; he fol- 
lowed his ſteps through the cloiſter, — 
he called—but he was gone. 


Alleyn had obſerved the Count with 
a mixture of pity and admiration; and 
he 


( 265) 


he fighed for the weakneſs of human 
nature. How,” ſaid the Earl, return- 
ing eagerly to Alleyn, — * how can [I 
recompenſe you for my injurious ſuſpi- 
cions, and my injurious treatment? — 
How can you forgive, or I forget, my 
injuſtice ? But the myſtery of this affairs 
and the doubtful appearance of circum- 
ſtances, muſt ſpeak for me.” „O 
let us talk no more of this, my lord,” 
replied Alleyn, with emotion; “let us 
only rejoice at the ſafety of our dear 
lady, and offer her the comfort ſhe is ſo 
much in want of.” The fire was re- 
kindled, and the Earl's ſervants laid 
before him ſome wine, and other provi- 
ſions. Mary, who had not taſted any 
food ſince ſhe left the caſtle, now took 
ſome wine; 1t revived her, and enabled 
her to take other nouriſhment. She en- 
quired, what happy circumſtance had 
enabled the Earl to trace her route. 
Ever ſince I diſcovered your flight,” 
ſaid he, «I have been in purſuit of you. 

N Chance 


( 266 ) 


Chance directed me over theſe wilds, 
when I was driven by the ſtorm to 
ſeck ſhelter among theſe ruins. The 
light, and an uproar of voices, drew me 
to the cloiſter, where, to my unutter- 
able aſtoniſhment, I diſcovered you and 
Alleyn: Spare me the remembrance of 
what followed.” Mary wiſhed to en- 
quire what brought Alleyn to the place; 
but delicacy kept her ſilent. Oſbert, 
however, whoſe anxiety for his ſiſter 
had hitherto allowed him to attend only 
to her, now relieved her from the pain 
of lengthened ſuſpenſe. By what 
ſtrange accident was you brought hi- 
ther?“ ſaid he to Alleyn, “and what 
motive has induced you ſo long to ab- 
ſent yourſelf from the caſtle ?* At the 
laſt queſtion, Alleyn bluſhed, and an 
involuntary ſigh eſcaped him. Mary 
underſtood the bluſh and the figh, and 
awaited his reply in trembling emotion. 
« I fled, my lord, from your diſplea- 
ſure, and to tear myſelf from an object

too dangerous, alas! for my peace. I 
ſought to wear away in abſence, a paſ- 
ſion which muſt ever be hopeleſs, but 
which, I now perceive, is interwoven 
with my exiſtence. But forgive, my 
lord, the intruſion of a ſubject which is 
painful to us all. With ſome money, 
and a few proviſions, I left my father's 
cottage; and ſince that time have wan- 
dered over the country a forlorn and 
miſerable being, paſſing my nights in 
the huts which chance threw in my way, 
and deſigning to travel onward, and to 
enliſt myſelf in the ſervice of my coun- 
try. Night overtook me on theſe waſtes, 
and as I walked on comfortleſs and be- 
wildered, I was alarmed by diſtant cries 
of diſtreſs. I quickened my pace; but 
the ſound which ſhould have directed 
my ſteps was ceaſed, and chilling 
filence enſued. As I ſtood muſing, and 
uncertain which courle to take, 1 ob- 


ſerved a feeble light break through the 


gloom; I endeavoured to follow its

rays; It led me to theſe ruins, whoſe 
ſolemn appearance ſtruck me with a mo- 
mentary dread. A confuſed murmur 
of voices from within ſtruck my ear; 
as I ſtood heſitating whether to enter, 1 
again heard thoſe ſhrieks which nad 
alarmed me. I followed the ſound; it led 
me to the entrance of this cloiſter, at the 
extremity of which I diſcovered a party of 
men engaged in fight; I drew my ſword 
and ruſhed forward; and the ſenſations 
which I felt, on perceiving the lady 
Mary, cannot be expreſſed!” „ Still, 
— ſill Heaven deſtines you the deliverer 
of Mary!” ſaid the Earl, gratitude 
ſwelling in his eyes; O!] that I could 
remove that obſtacle which with-holds 
you from your juſt reward! A reſpon- 
tive figh ſtole from Alleyn, and he re- 
mained ſilent. Never was the ſtruggle 
of oppoſing feelings more violent, than 
that which now agitated the boſom of 
the Earl. The worth of Alleyn aroſe 
more conſpicuouſly bright from every

( 0] 


ſhade with which misfortune had veiled 
it. His noble and diſintereſted enthu- 
ſiaſm in the cauſe of juſtice, had attached 
him to the Earl, and had engaged him 
in a courſe of enterprizes and of dangers, 
which 1t required valour to undertake, 
and kill and perſeverance to perform; 
and which had produced ſervices for 
which no adequate reward could be 
found. He had reſcued the Earl from 
captivity and death; and had twice pre- 
ſerved Mary in dangers. All theſe cir- 
cumſtances aroſe in ſtrong reflection to 
the mind of Oſbert ; but the darkneſs of 
prejudice and ancient pride, oppoſed 
their influence, and weakened their 
effect. f 


The joy which Mary felt on ſeeing 
Alleyn in ſafety, and ſtill worthy of the 
eſteem ſhe had ever bore him, was 
daſhed by the bitterneſs of reflection; 
and reflection imparted a melancholy 
which added to the languor of. illneſs.

At the dawn of day they quitted the ab- 
bey, and ſet forward on their return to 
the caſtle; the Earl inſiſting upon Al- 
leyn's accompanying them. On the way, 
the minds of the party* were variouſly 
and filently engaged. The Ear] rumi- 
nated on the conduct of Alleyn, and the 
late ſcene. Mary dwelt chiefly on the vir- 
tues of her lover, and on the dangers ſhe 
had eſcaped; and Alleyn muſed on his 
defeated purpoſes, and anticipated fu- 
ture trials. The Earl's thoughts, how- 
ever, were not ſo wholly occupied, as to 
prevent his queſtioning the ſervant who 
had been employed by the Count, con- 
cerning the further particulars of his 
ſcheme. The words of the Count, import- 
ing that he had once already endangered 
his life, had not eſcaped the notice of 
the Earl; though they were uttered in a 
moment of too much diſtraction to ſuf- 


fer him todemand an explanation. He 


now enquired of the man, concerning 
the myſterious ſcene of the vaults. 
| « You 


„ 
* You, I ſuppoſe, are not ignorant who 
were the perſons from whom J received 
my wound.” ©], my lord, had no 
concern in that affair; wicked as I am, 
I could not raiſe my hands againſt your 
life.“ „But you know who did.” I 
—[—ye—yes, my lord, I was after- 
wards told. But they did not mean to 
hurt your lordſhip,” © Not mean to 
hurt me!—What then were their de- 
ſigns, and who were the people?” 
„That accident happened long before 
the Count ever ſpoke to me of his pur- 
poſe. Indeed, my lord, I had no hand 
in it; and Heaven knows how I grieved 
for your lordſhip; and EE, 
well, inform me, who were the per- 
ſons in the vaults, and what were their 
deſign.” „I was told by a fellow ſer- 
vant; but he made me promiſe to be 
ſecret; but it is proper your lordſhip 


ſhould know all; and 1 hope your 


lordſhip will forgive me for having 
liſtened to 1t.— Robert, ſaid he, as 
N 4 we

we were talking one day of what had 
happened ;— Robert,“ ſaid he, there 
is more in this matter than you, or any 
body thinks; but it is not for me to 
tell all I know.“ With that, 1 begged 
he would tell me what he knew ; but 
he ſtill kept refuſing. I promiſed him 
taithtully I would not tell; and ſo at 
laſt he told me— Why, there is my 
lord Count there, he is in love with our 
young lady; and to be ſure as {ſweet a 
lady ſhe is, as ever eyes looked upon ; 
but ſhe don't like him; and ſo finding 
himſelf refuſed, he is determined to 
marry her at any rate; and means ſome 
night to get into the caſtle, . and carry 
her off.)“ What, then !--was it the 
Count who wounded me?—Be quick 
in your relation.” © No, my lord, it 
was not the Count himſelf—but two 
of his people, whom he had ſent to 
examine the caſtle; and particularly 
the windows of my young lady's apart- 
ment, from whence he deſigned to have 
carried 


E 

carried her, when every thing was ready 
for execution. Thoſe men were let 
within the walls through a way under 
ground, which leads into the vaults, 
by my fellow ſervant, as I afterwards 
was told; and they eſcaped through the 
ſame way. Their meeting with your 
lordihip was accidental, and they fought 
only in ſelf-defence; for they had no 
orders to attack any body.” © And 
who 1s the villain that connived at this 
ſcheme?” © Ir was my fellow ſervant, 
who fled with the Count's people, whom 
he himſelf et within the ramparts. 
Forgive me, my lord ; but I did not 
dare tell; he threatened my life, if I 
betrayed the ſecret.” 


After a journey of fatigue, and un- 
pleaſant reflections, they arrived on the 
ſecond morning at the caſtle of Athlin. 
The Counteſs, during the abſence of her 
ſon, had endured a ſtate of dreadſul 
ſuſpenſe. The Baroneſs, in her friend- 

hip, 


„ 


ſhip, had endeavoured to ſoothe her 
diſtreſs, by her conſtant preſence; ſhe 
was engaged in this amiable office, 
when the trampling of horſes in the 
court reached the ears of Matilda. 
« It is my ſon,” ſaid ſhe, riſing from 
her chair !—* it is my ſon; he brings 
me life or death! She ſaid no more, 
but ruſhed into the hall, and in a mo- 
ment after claſped her almoſt expiring 
daughter to her boſom, The tranſport 
of the ſcene repelled utterance; ſobs 
and tears were all that could be given. 
The general joy, however, was ſuddenly 
interrupted by the Baroneſs, who had 
followed Matilda into the hall; and 
who now fell ſenſeleſs to the ground ; 
delight yielded to ſurprize, and to the 
buſineſs of aſſiſting the object of it. On 
recovering, the Baroneſs looked wildly 
round her; —“ Was it a viſion that I 
law, or a reality?” The whole com- 
pany moved their eyes round the hall, 
but could diſcover nothing extraordi- 

nary. 


nary. © It was himſelf; his very air, 
his features; that benign countenance 
which J have ſo often contemplated in 
imagination!” Her eyes ſtill ſeemed 
in ſearch of ſome ideal object; and 
they began to doubt whether a ſudden 
phrenzy had not ſeized her brain. 
« Ah! again! ſaid ſhe, and inſtantly 
_ relapſed. Their eyes were now turned 
towards the door, on which ſhe had 
gazed; it was Alleyn who entered, with 
water which he had brought for the 
Counteſs, and on whom the attention 
of all preſent was now centered. He 
approached ignorant of what had hap- 
pened; and his ſurprize was great, 
when the Baroneſs, reviving, fixed her 
eyes mournfully upon him, and aſked 
him to uncover his arm.—* It is,— 
it is my Philip!“ ſaid ſhe, with ſtrong 
emotion; I have, indeed, found my 
long loſt child ; that ſtrawberry on his 
arm confirms the deciſion. Send for 
the man who calls himſelf your father, 


(20 } 


and for my ſervant Patrick.” The ſen- 
_ fations of the mother and the ſon may 
be more eaſily conceived than deſcribed ; 
thoſe of Mary were little interior to 
theirs; and the whole company awaited 
with trembling eagerneſs the arrival of 
the two perſons whoſe teſtimony was 
to decide this intereſting affair. They 
came. © This young man you call 
your ſon?” ſaid the Baroneſs. © I do, 
an' pleaſe your ladyſhip,“ he replied, 
with a degree of confuſion which belied 
his words. When Patrick came, his 
inſtant ſurprize on ſeeing the old man, 
declared the truth. © Do you know 
this perſon?” ſaid the Baroneſs. to 
Patrick. © Yes, my lady, I know him 
too well; it was to him 1 gave your 
infant ſon.” The old man ſtarted with 
ſurprize “ Is that youth the ſon of 
your © dyſhip??” © Yes!” Then 
God forgive me for having thus long 
detained him from you! but I was ig- 
norant of his birth, and received him 

into 


6277 ) 


into my cottage as a foundling ſuc. 
coured by lord Malcolm's compaſſion.““ 
The whole company crowded round 
them. Alleyn fell at the feet of his 
mother, and bathed her hand with his 
tears.“ Gracious God! for what haſt 
thou reſerved me!” He could ſay no 
more. The Baroneſs raiſed him, and 
again preſſed him in tranſport to her 
heart. It was ſome time before either 
of them could ſpeak; and all preſent 
were too much affected to interrupt the 
filence. At length, the Baroneſs pre- 
ſented Laura to her brother. Such a 
mother! and have I ſuch a lifter!” 
aid he. Laura wept ſilently upon his 
neck the joy of her heart. The Earl 
was the firſt who recovered compoſure 
ſufficient to congratulate Alleyn ; and 
embracing him—O happy moment, 
when I can indeed embrace you as my 
brother! The whole company now 
poured forth their joy and their con- 
gratulations; —all but Mary, whole 
| — | EIMOTLONS 


TFT 298 3 


emotions almoſt overcame her, and were 
too powerful for utterance. 


The company now adjourned to the 
drawing-room ; and Mary withdrew to 
take that repoſe ſhe ſo much required. 
She was fufficiently recovered in a few 
hours to join her friends in the ban- 


quetting- room. 


After the tranſports of the ſcene were 
ſubſided—“ I have yet much to hope, 
and much to fear,” ſaid Philip Mal- 
colm, who was yet Alleyn in every 
thing but in name. © You, madam,” 
addreſſing the Baroneſs, —* you will 
willingly become my advocate with her 
whom I have ſo long and fo ardently 
loved.” “ May 1 hope,“ continued he, 
taking tenderly the hand of Mary, who 
ſtood trembling by,. —“ that you have 
not been inſenſible to my long attach- 
ment, and that you will confirm the 


happineſs which is now offered me?” 
A ſmile 


( 8 7F- 
A ſmile of ineffable ſweetneſs broke 
through the melancholy which had long 
clouded her features, and which even 
the preſent diſcovery had not been able 
entirely to diſſipate, and her eye gave 
the conſent which her tongue refuſed to 
utter. 
Ihe converſation, for the remainder 
of the day, was occupied by the ſubject 
of the diſcovery, and with a recital of 
Mary's adventure. It was determined 
that on the morrow the marriage of the 
Earl ſhould be concluded. 

On this happy diſcovery, the Ear! 
ordered the gates of the caſtle to be 
thrown open; mirth and feſtivity re- 
ſounded through the walls, and the 
evening cloſed in univerſal rejoicings. 

On the following morn, the chapel 
of the caſtle was decorated for the mar- 
riage of the Earl; who with Laura, 
came attended by Philip, now Baron 
Malcolm, by Mary, and the whole fa- 
mily. When they approached the al- 
tar, the Earl addreſſing himſelf to his 
bride,

bride,—&lt; Now, my Laura,” ſaid he, 
cc we may celebrate thoſe nuptials which 
have twice been ſo painfully interrupt- 
ed, and which are to crown me with 
felicity. This day ſhall unite our fami- 
liesin a double marriage, and reward 
the worth of my friend. It is now ſeen, 
that thoſe virtues which ſtimulated him 
to proſecute for another the cauſe of 
Juſtice, myſteriouſly urged him to 
the recovery of his rights. Virtue may 
for a time be purſued by misfortune. — 
and juſtice be obſcured by the tranſient 
triumphs of vice, — but the power whoſe 
peculiar attributes they are, clears away 
the clouds of error, and even in this world 
reveals his THRONE OF JUSTICE,” 
The Earl ſtepped forward, and join- 
ing the hands of Philip and Mary,— 
« Surely, ſaid he, this is a moment of 
perfect happineſs !—I can now reward 
thoſe virtues which I have ever loved; and 
thoſe ſervices to which every gift muſt 
be inadequate, but this I now beſtow,”
