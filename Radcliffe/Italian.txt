He, wrapt in clouds of myſtery and filence,

And ſends them forth on wings of Fate to others: 
Like the inviſible Will, chat guides us, 

Unheard, unknown, unſearchable ! 

Aron the year 1764, fome Engliſh 
travellers in Italy, during one of their ex- 
curſions in the environs of Naples, hap- 
pened to ſtop before the portico of the 
Santa Maria del Pianto, a church be- 
longing to a very ancient convent of the 
order of the Black Penitents. The magni— 
ficence of this portico, though impaired 
by time, excited ſo much admiration, 
that the travellers were curious to ſur— 
vey the ſtruQture to which it belonged, 
and with this intention they aſcended the 
marble ſteps that led to it. 

Within the ſhade of the portico, a per- 
fon with folded arms, and eyes directed 
towards the ground, was pacing behind 
the pillars the whole extent of the pave- 
ment, and was apparently ſo engaged by 
his own thoughts, -as not to obſerve that 
ſtrangers were approaching. He turned, 
however, ſuddenly, as if ſtartled by the 
ſound of ſteps, and then, without further 
pauſing, glided to a door that opened 
into the church, and diſappeared. 

There was ſomething too extraordinary 
in the appearance of this man, and too 
ſingular in his conduct, to paſs unno- 
ticed by the viſitors. He was of a tall 
thin figure, bending forward from the 
ſhoulders ; of a fallow complexion, and 
harſh features, and had an eye, which, as 
it looked up from the cloke that muffled 
the lower part of his countenance, ſeemed 
expreſſive of uncommon ferocity. 

The travellers, on entering the church, 
looked round for the ſtranger, who had

paſſed thither before them, but he was no 
where to be ſeen, and, through all the 
ſhade of the long aiſles, only one other 
perſon appeared. This was a friar of the 
adjoining convent, who ſometimes pointed 
out to viſitors the objects in the church, 
which were molt worthy of attention, and 
who now, with this deſign, approached 
the party that had juſt entered. 

The interior of this edifice had nothing 
of the ſhewy ornament and general ſplen- 
dor, which diſtinguiſh the churches of 
Italy, and particularly thoſe of Naples ; 
but it exhibited a ſimplicity and grandeur 
of deſign, conſiderably more intereſting 
to perſons of taſte, and a ſolemnity of 
light and ſhade much more ſuitable to 
promote the ſublime elevation of devo- 
tion. | 

When the party had viewed the differ- 
ent ſhrines and whatever had been judged - 
worthy of obſervation, and were return- 
ing through an obſcure aiſle towards the 

43 portico, 


„ 


portico, they perceived the perſon, who 
had appeared upon the ſteps, paſſing 
towards a confeſfional on the left, and, as 
he entered it, one of the party pointed 
him out to the friar, and enquired who 
he was; the friar turning to look after 
him, did not immediately reply, but, on 
the queſtion being repeated, he inclined 
his head, as in a kind of obeiſance, and 
calmly replied, © He is an aſſaſſin.“ 

« An aſſaſſin!'“ exclaimed one of the 
Engliſhmen; © an aſſaſſin and at li- 
berty!“ | 
An Italian gentleman, who was of the 
party, ſmiled at the aſtomſhment of his 
triend. 

« He has ſought ſanctuary here,“ re- 
plied the friar ; „within theſe walls he 
may not be moleſted.“ 

« Do your altars, then, protect the 
murderer ?” ſaid the Engliſhman: | 

He could find thelter no where elſe,” 


anſwered the friar meekly.

„This is aſtoniſhing !”” ſaid the Eng- 
liſnman; * of what avail are your laws, 
if the moſt atrocious criminal may thus 
find ſhelter from them ? But how does he 
contrive to exiſt here! He is, at leaſt, 
in danger of being ſtarved ?”? 

Pardon me,” replied the friar; © there 
are always people willing to aſſiſt thoſe, 
who cannot aſſiſt themſelves; and, as 
the criminal may not leave the church 
in ſearch of food, they bring it to him 
here.“ 

Is this poſſible ”? ſaid the Engliſh- 
man, turning to his Italian friend. 

«© Why, the poor wretch muſt not 
ſtarve,” replied the friend; “which he 
inevitably would do, if food were not 
brought to him! But have you never, 
ſince your arrival in Italy, happened to 
ſee a perſon in the ſituation of this 


man ? It is by no means an uncommon 
one.“ 


A 4 Never!“ 


C8: 

„ Never!” anſwered the Engliſhman, 
and I can ſcarcely credit what I ſee 
now!“ 

Why, my friend,“ obſerved the Ita- 
lian, © aſſaſſinations are ſo frequent, that, 
if we were to ſhew no mercy to ſuch 
unfortunate perſons, our cities would be 
half depopulated.“ 

In notice of this profound remark, the 
Engliſhman could only gravely bow. 

« But obſerve yonder confeſſional,” 
added the Italian, “that beyond the pil- 
lars on the left of the aiſle, below a 
painted window. . Have you diſcovered 
it? The colours of the glaſs throw, in- 
ſtead of light, a ſhade over that part of 
the church, which, perhaps, prevents your 
duſtinguiſhing what I mean!“ 

The Engliſhman looked whither his 
friend pointed, and obſerved a confeſ- 
ſional of oak, or ſome very dark wood, 
ad,oining the wall, and remarked allo, 


that it was the ſame, which the aſſaſſin 
| had 


2933 

had juſt entered. It conſiſted of three 
compartments, covered with a black ca- 
nopy. In the central diviſion was the 
chair of the confeſſor, elevated by ſeve- 
ral ſteps above the pavement of the 
church ; and on either hand was a ſmall 
cloſet, or box, with ſteps leading up to 
a grated partition, at which the peni- 
tent might kneel, and, concealed from 
obſervation, pour into the ear of the con- 
feſſor, the conſciouſneſs of crimes that 
lay heavy on his heart. 

«© You obſerve it?“ ſaid the Italian. 

* do,” replied the Engliſhman ; © it 
is the ſame, which the aſſaſſin has paſſed 
into; and I think it one of the moſt 
gloomy ſpots I ever beheld; the view 
of it is enough to ſtrike a criminal with 
deſpair !” 

We, in Italy, are not ſo apt to deſ- 
pair,“ replied the Italian ſmilingly. 

„ Well, but what of this confeſſional?“ 
enquired the Engliſhman, © The aſſaſſin 
entered it!“ 

AS «© He. 


13 

« He has no relation, with what I am 
about to mention,” ſaid the Italian; 
„ but I wiſh you to mark the place, be- 
cauſe ſome very eee circum- 
ſtances belong to it.“ 

« What are they?” ſaid the Engliſh- 
man. 

It is now ſeveral years ſince the con- 
feſſion, which is connected with them, was 
made at that very confeſſional,“ added 
the Italian; © the view of it, and the ſight 
of this aſſaſſin, with your ſurprize at the 
liberty which is allowed him, led me to 
a recollection of the ſtory. When you 
return to the hotel, I will communicate 
it to you, if you have no plealanter way 
of engaging your time, 

“ have a curioſity to hear it,“ re- 
plied the Engliſhman, “cannot you re- 
late it now ?”? 

It is much too long to be related 
now; that would occupy a week; I 
have it in writing, and will ſend you the 
volume. A young ſtudent of Padua, 

who

who happened to be at Naples ſoon after 
this horrible confeſſion became pub- 
lic“ 

&amp; Pardon me,” interrupted the Eng- 
liſhman; © that is ſurely very extraor- 
dinary. I thought confeſſions were al- 
ways held ſacred by the prieſt, to whom 
they were made.” 

6 Your obſervation is reaſonable,” 
rejoined the Italian; “ the faith of the 
prieſt is never broken, except by an 
eſpecial command from an higher power ; 
and the circumſtances muſt even then be 
very extraordinary to juſtify ſuch a depar- 
ture from the law. But, when you read 
the narrative, your ſurpriſe on this head 
will ceaſe. I was going to tell you, that 
it was written by a ſtudent of Padua, 
who, happening to be here ſoon after the 
affair became public, was ſo much ſtruck 
with the facts, that, partly as an exerciſe, 
and partly in return for ſome trifling ſer- 
vices I had rendered him, he committed

them to paper for me. You will perceive 
from the work, that this ſtudent was 
very young, as to the arts of compoſi- 
tion, but the facts are what you require, 
and from theſe he has not deviated. 
But come, let us leave the church.“ 

« After I have taken another view of 
this ſolemn edifice,” replied the Eng- 
liſhman, and particularly of the con- 
feſſional you have pointed to my notice!“ 

While the Engliſhman glanced his eye 
over the high roofs, and along the 
ſolemn perſpectives of the Santa del 
Pianto, he perceived the figure of the 
aſſaſſin ſtealing from the confeſſional 
acroſs the choir, and, ſhocked on again 
beholding him, he turned his eyes, and 
haſtily quitted the church. | 

The friends then ſeparated, and the 
Engliſhman, ſoon after returning to his 
hotel, received the volume. He read as 
follows:

MysTtr1iOuUs MoTHER, 


I T was in the church of San Lorenzo 
at Naples, in the year 1758, that Vin- 
centio di Vivaldi firſt ſaw Ellena Roſalba. 
The ſweetneſs and fine expreſſion of her 
voice attracted his attention to her figure, 
which had a diſtinguiſhed air of delicacy 
and grace ; but her face was concealed 
in her veil. So much indeed was he 
faſcinated by the voice, that a moſt pain- 
ful curioſity was excited as to her coun- 
tenance, which he fancied mult expreſs 

all 


( 14 ) 
all the ſenſibility of character that the 
modulation of her tones indicated. He 
liſtened to their exquiſite expreſſion with 
a rapt attention, and hardly withdrew 
his eyes from her perſon till the matin 
ſervice had concluded ; when he obſerved 
her leave the church with an aged lady, 
who leaned upon her arm, and who ap- 
peared to be her mother. 

Vivaldi immediately followed their 
ſteps, determined to obtain, if poſſible, a 
view of Ellena's face, and to obſerve the 
home to which ſhe ſhould retire. They 
walked quickly, looking neither to the 
right or left, and as they turned into the 
Strada di Toledo he had nearly loſt 
them; but quickening his pace, and re- 
linquiſhing the cautious diſtance he had 
hitherto kept, he overtook them as they 
entered on the Terrazzo Nuovo, which 
runs along the bay of Naples, and leads 
towards the Gran Corſo. He overtook 
them; but the fair unknown ſtill held 

her 


WED 


her veil cloſe, and he knew not how to 
introduce himſelf to her notice, or to 
| obtaih a view of the features, which ex- 
cited his curioſity. He was embarraſſed 
by a reſpectful timidity, that mingled 
. with his admiration, and which kept him 
ſilent, notwithſtanding his wiſh to ſpeak. 
In deſcending the laſt ſteps of the Ter- 
razzo, however, the foot of the elder lady 
faltered, and, while Vivald: haſtened to 
aſſiſt her, the breeze from the water 
caught the veil, which Ellena had no 
longer a hand ſufficiently diſengaged to 
confine, and, wafting it partially aſide, 
diſcloſed to him a countenance more 
touchingly beautiful than he had dared to 
image. Her features were of the Grecian 
outline, and, though they expreſſed the 
tranquillity of an elegant mind, her dark 
blue eyes ſparkled with intelligence. She 
was aſſiſting her companion ſo anx1oully, 
as not immediately to obſerve the admira- 
tion ſhe had inſpired ; but the moment 
her 


10 
her eyes met thoſe of Vivaldi, ſhe be- 
came conſcious of the effect, and haſtily 
drew her veil. 

The old lady was not materially hurt by 
her fall, but, as ſhe walked with difficulty, 
Vivaldi ſeized the opportunity thus of- 
fered, and infiſted that ſhe ſhould accept 
his arm. She refuſed this with many ac- 
knowledgments; but he preſſed the 
offer ſo repeatedly and reſpeQtully, that, 
at length, ſhe accepted it, and they walk- 
ed towards her reſidence together. 

On the way thither, he attempted to 
converſe with Ellena, but her replies were 
conciſe, and he arrived at the end of the 
walk while he was yet conſidering what 
he could ſay, that might intereſt and with- 
draw her from this ſevere reſerve. From 
the ſtyle of their reſidence, he imagined 
that they were perſons of honourable, 
but moderate independence. The houſe 
was ſmall, but exhibited an air of com- 
fort, and even of taſte. It ſtood on an 

| 8 eminence, 


C87") 

eminence, ſurrounded by a garden and 
vineyards, which commanded the city 
and bay of Naples, an ever-moving pic- 
ture, and was canopied by a thick grove 
of pines and majeſtic date trees; and, 
though the little portico and collonade 
in front were of common marble, the 
ſtyle of architecture was elegant. While 
they afforded a ſhelter from the ſun, 
they admitted the cooling breezes that 
roſe from the bay below, and a proſpect 
of the whole ſcope of its enchanting 
ſhores. 

Vivaldi ſtopped at the little gate, which 
led into the garden, where the elder lady 
repeated her acknowledgments for his 
care, but did not invite him to enter ; and 
he, trembling with anxiety and ſinking 
with diſappointment, remained for a mo- 
ment gazing upon Ellena, unable to take 
leave, yet irreſolute what to ſay that 
might prolong the interview, till the old 
lady again bade him good-day. He then 

ſum-

ſummoned courage enough to requeſt he 
might be allowed to enquire after her 


health, and, having obtained a reluctant 


permiſſion, his eyes bade adieu to Ellena, 
who, as they were parting, ventured to 
thank him for the care he had taken of 
her aunt. The ſound of her voice, and 
this acknowledgment of obligation, made 
him leſs willing to go than before, but at 
length he tore himſelf away. The beau- 


ty of her countenance haunting his ima- 
gination, and the touching accents of 
her voice ſtill vibrating on his heart, he 


deſcended to the ſhore below her reſi- 
dence, pleaſing himſelf with the conſciouſ- 
neſs of being near her, though he could 
no longer behold her; and ſometimes 
hoping that he might again ſee her, how- 
ever diſtantly, in a balcony of the houſe, 
where the filk awning ſeemed to invite 
the breeze from the ſea. He lingered 
hour after hour, ſtretched beneath the 
umbrageous pines that waved over the 

ſhore, 


( 19 ) 


jhore, or traverſing, regardleſs of the 
heat, the baſe of the clifts that crowned 
it ; recalling to his fancy the enchant- 
ment of her ſmile, and ſeeming {till to 
liſten to the ſweetneſs of her accents. 

In the evening he returned to his 
tather's palace at Naples, thoughtful yet 
pleaſed, anxious yet happy; dwelling 
with delightful hope on the remembrance 
of the thanks he had received from El- 
lena, yet not daring to form any plan as 
to his future conduct. He returned 
time enough to attend his mother in her 
evening ride on the Corſo, where, in 
every gay carriage that paſſed, he hoped 
to ſee the object of his conſtant thought ; 
but ſhe did not appear, His mother, the 
Marcheſa di Vivaldi, obſerved his an- 
xiety and unuſual filence, and aſked him 
ſome queſtions, which ſhe meant ſhould 
lead to an explanation of the change in 
his manners; but his replies only excited 
a ftronger curioſity, and, though ſhe 


forbore 


C9 3 


forbore to preſs her enquiries, it was, 
probably, that ſhe might employ a more 
artful means of renewing them. 
Vincentio di Vivaldi was the only ſon 
of the Marcheſe di Vivaldi, a nobleman 
of one of the moſt ancient families of the 
kingdom of Naples, a favourite poſſeſſing 
an uncommon ſhare of influence at Court, 
a man ſtill higher in power than in rank. 
His pride of birth was equal to either, 
but it was mingled with the juſtifiable 
pride of a principled mind ; it governed 
his conduct in morals as well as in the 
jealouſy of ceremonial diſtinctions, and 
elevated his practice as well as his claims. 
His pride was at once his vice and his 
virtue, his ſafeguard and his weakneſs. 
The mother of Vivaldi, deſcended from 
a family as ancient as that of his father, 
was equally jealous of her importance 
but her pride was that of birth and dif. 
tinction, without extending to morals. 
She was of violent paſſions, haughty, 
vindic- 


1 

vindictive, yet crafty and deceitful; pa- 
tient in ſtratagem, and indefatigable in 
purſuit of vengeance, on the unhappy 
objects who provoked her reſentment. 
She loved her ſon, rather as being the 
laſt of two illuſtrious houſes, who was 
to re-unite and ſupport the honour of 
both, than with the fondneſs of a mo- 
ther. 

Vincentio inherited much of the cha- 
racter of his father, and very little of that 
of his mother. His pride was as noble 
and generous as that of the Marcheſe 
but he had ſomewhat of the fiery paſſions 
of the Marcheſa, without any of her 
craft, her duplicity, or vindiQtive thirſt of 
revenge. Frank in his temper, inge- 
nuous in his ſentiments, quickly offended, 
but eaſily appeaſed ; irritated by any ap- 
pearance of diſreſpe&amp;, but melted by a 
conceſſion, a high ſenſe of honor ren- 
dered him no more jealous of offence, 
than a delicate humanity made him ready 

« tor 


C08] 
for reconciliation, and anxious to ſpare 
the feelings of others. 

On the day following that, on which 
he had ſeen Ellena, he returned to the 
Villa Altieri, to uſe the permiſhon grant- 
ed him of enquiring after the health of 
Signora Bianchi. The expeQation of 
ſeeing Ellena agitated him with impatient 
joy and trembling hope, which ſtill en- 
creaſed as he approached her reſidence, 
till, having reached the garden-gate, he 
was obliged to reſt for a few moments to 
recover breath and compofure. 

Having announced himſelf to an old 
female ſervant, who came to the gate, he 
was ſoon after admitted to a ſmall veſti- 
bule, where he found Bianchi winding 
balls of filk, and alone; though from 
the poſition of a chair, which ſtood near a 
frame for embroidery, he judged that 
Ellena had but juſt quitted the apartment. 
Signora Bianchi received him with a re- 
ſerved politeneſs, and ſeemed very cau- 


1 tious 


1 


tious in her replies to his enquiries after 
” herniece, who, he hoped, every moment, 


would appear. He lengthened his viſit 
till there was no longer an excuſe for 
doing ſo; till he had exhauſted every 
topic of converſation, and till the filence 
of Bianchi ſeemed to hint, that his depar- 
ture was expected. With a heart ſad- 
dened by diſappointment, and having ob- 
tained only a reluctant permiſſion to en- 
quire after the health of that lady on ſome 
future day, he then took leave. 

On his way through the garden he 
often pauſed to look back upon the 
houſe, hoping to obtain a glimpſe of El- 
lena at a lattice; and threw a glance 
around him, almoſt expecting to ſee her 
ſeated beneath the ſhade of the luxuriant 
plantains; but his ſearch was every 
where vain, and he quitted the place 


with the flow and heavy ſtep of deſpond- 
ency. 


The 


(24) 


The day was employed in endeavours 
to obtain intelligence concerning the fa. 
mily of Ellena, but of this he procured 
little that was ſatisfactory. He was told, 
that ſhe was an orphan, living under the 
care of her aunt, Signora Bianchi ; that 
her family, which had never been illuſ- 
trious, was decayed in fortune, and that 
her only dependence was upon this aunt. 
But he was ignorant of what was very 
true, though very ſecret, that ſhe aſſiſted 
to ſupport this aged relative, whoſe ſole 
property was the ſmall eſtate on which 
they lived, and that ſhe paſſed whole days 
in embroidering filks, which were dif- 
poſed of to the nuns of a neighbouring 
convent, who ſold them to the Neapoli- 
tan ladies, that viſited their grate, at a 
very high advantage. He little thought, 
that a beautiful robe, which he had often 


ſeen his mother wear, was worked by El- 


lena; nor that ſome copies from the 


antique, which ornamented a cabinet of

the Vivaldi palace, were drawn by her 
hand. If he had known theſe circum- 
ſtances, they would only have ſerved to 
encreaſe the tenderneſs, which, ſince they 
were proofs of a diſparity of fortune, that 
would certainly render his family re- 
pugnant to a connection with hers, it 
would have been prudent to overcome. 

Ellena could have endured poverty, 
but not contempt: and it was to protect 
herſelf from this effect of the narrow pre- 
judices of the world around her, that ſhe 
had ſo cautiouſly concealed from. it a 
knowledge of the induſtry, which did 
honour to her character. She was not 
aſhamed of poverty, or of the induſtry 
which overcame it, but her ſpirit ſhrunk 
from the ſenſeleſs ſmile and humiliating 
condeſcenſion, which proſperity ſome- 
times gives to indigence. Her mind was 
not yet ſtrong enough, or her views 
ſufficiently enlarged, to teach her a con- 
tempt of the ſneer of vicious folly, and to

glory in the dignity of virtuous danced. 
ence, Ellena was the ſole ſupport of 
her aunt's declining years; was patient 
to her inſirmities, and conſoling to her 
ſufferings ; and repaid the fondneſs of a 
mother with the affection of a daughter. 
Her mother ſhe had never known, hav- 
ing loſt her while ſhe was an infant, and 
from that period Bianchi had practiſed 
the kindneſs of one towards her. 

Thus innocent and happy in the ſilent 
performance of her duties and in the veil 
of retirement, lived Ellena Roſalba, when 
ſhe firſt ſaw Vincentio di Vivaldi. He 
was not of a figure to paſs unobſerved 
when ſeen, and Ellena had been ſtruck 
by the ſpirit and dignity of his air, and 
by his countenance, fo frank, noble, and 
full of that kind of expreſſion, which an- 
nounces the energies of the ſoul. But 
ſhe was eautigus of admitting a ſenti- 
ment more tender than admiration, and

coccupations, to recover the ſtate of tran- 
quillity, which his appearance had ſome- 
what interrupted. 
Vivaldi, mean while, reſtleſs from dif. 
appointment, and impatient from an-

the day in enquiries, which repaid him 


only with doubt and apprehenſion, de- 


termined to return to Villa Altieri, when

by the certainty of being near the object

The Marcheſa Vivaldi held an aſſembly 
this evening, and a ſuſpicion concerning 
che impatience he betrayed, induced her 
to detain him about her perſon to a late 
hour, engaging him to ſelect the muſic 
for her orcheſtra, and to ſuperintend the 
performance of a new piece, the wotk of

faſhion. Her aſſemblies were among the 
moſt brilliant and crowded in Naples, 
and the nobility, who were to be at the 
palace this evening, were divided into 
two parties as to the merits of the muſi- 
cal genius, whom ſhe patronized, and 
thoſe of another candidate for fame. The 
performance of the evening, it was ex- 
pected, would finally decide the victory. 
This, therefore, was a night of great im- 
portance and anxiety to the Marcheſa, 
for ſhe was as jealous of the reputation of 
her favourite compoſer as of her n, 
and the welfare of her ſon did but ſlightly 
divide her cares. 
The moment he could depart unob- 
ſerved, he quitted the afſembly, and 
muffling himſelf in his cloak, haſtened to 
Villa Altieri, which lay at a ſhort diſtance 
to the weſt of the city. He reached it 
unobſerved, and, breathleſs with impa- 
tience, traverſed the boundary of the gar- 
den; where, free from ceremonial re-

be experienced for the few firſt moments 


a joy as exquiſite as her preſence .could 
have inſpired. But this delight faded 


* With its novelty, and in a ſhort time he 


felt as forlorn as if he wag ſeparated for 


ever from Ellena, in whoſe preſence he 
but lately almoſt believed himſelf. 


The night was far advanced, and, no 
light. appearing from the houſe, he con- 
cluded the inhabitants had retired to reſt, 
and all hope of ſeeing her vaniſhed from 
his mind. Still, however, it was ſweet 
to be near her, and he anxiouſly ſought 
to gain admittance to the gardens, that 
he might approach the window where 1t 
was poſlible ſhe repoſed. The boundary, 
formed of trees and thick ſhrubs, was not 
difficult to be paſſed, and he found him- 
ſelf once more in the portico of the villa, 

It was nearly midnight, and the ſtill- 
neſs that reigned was rather ſoothed than

E 

waters of the bay below, and by the hol- 
low murmurs of Veſuvius, which threw 
up, at intervals, its ſudden flame on the 
horizon, and then left it to darkneſs. 
The ſolemnity of the ſcene accorded with 
the temper of Þis mind, and he liſtened 
in deep attention for the returning ſounds, 
which broke upon the ear like diſtant 
thunder muttering imperfectly from the 
clouds. The pauſes of ſilence, that ſuc- 
eeeded each groan of the mountain; 
when expectation liſtened for the riſing 
ſound, affected the imagination of Vivaldi 
at this time with particular awe, and, 
rapt in thought, he continued to gaze 
upon the ſublime and ſhadowy outline of 
the ſhores, and on the ſea, juſt diſcerned 
beneath the twilight of a cloudleſs ſky. 
Along its grey ſurface many veſſels were 
purſuing their filent courſe, guided over 
the deep waters only by the polar ſtar, 
which burned with ſteady luſtre. The 
air was calm, and roſe from the bay with 

. molt

; molt balmy and refreſhing coolneſs: 3 it 


ſcarcely ſtirred the heads of the broad 
pines that overſpread the villa; and bore 


no ſounds but of the waves and the 


groans of the far-olf mountain,—till a 
chaunting of deep voices {ſwelled from a 
diſtance. The ſolemn charaQer of the 
ſtrain engaged his attention; he per- 
ceived that it was a requiem, and he en- 
deavoured to difcover from what quarter 
it came. It advanced, though diſtantly, 
and then paſſed away on the air. The 
eircumſtanee ſtruck him; he knew it 


was uſual in ſome parts of Italy to chaunt 


this ſtrain over the bed of the dying ; 
but here the mourners ſeemed to walk 
the earth, or the air. He was not doubt- 
ful as to the ſtrain itſelf ; - once before he 
had heard it, and attended with circum» 


ſtances which made it impoſſible that he 


ſhould ever forget it. As he now liſten- 
ed to the choral voices ſoftening into 
diſtance, a few pathetic notes brought 


B 4 full 


CI 3 


full upon his remembrance the divine 
melody he had heard Ellena utter in the 
church of San Lorenzo, Overcome by 
the recollection, he ſtarted away, and 
wandering over the garden, reached an- 
other ſide of the villa, where he ſoon 
heard the voice of Ellena herſelf, per- 
torming the midnight hymn to the Vir- 
gin, and accompanied by a lute, which 
the touched with moſt affecting and deli- 
cate expreſſion. He itood for a moment 
entranced, and ſcarcely daring to breathe, 
leſt he ſhould loſe any note of that meek 
and holy ſtrain, which ſeemed to flow 
from a devotion almoſt faintly. Then, 
looking round to diſcover the object of 
his admiration, a light iſſuing from among 
the bowery foliage of a clematis led him 
to a lattice, and ſhewed him Ellena, 
The lattice had been thrown open to 
-admit the cool air, and he had a full 
view of her and the apartment. She was 
riſing from a ſmall altar where ſhe had 
| con- 


(33 ) 
concluded the ſervice; the glow of de- 
votion was ſtill upon her countenance as 
ſhe raiſed her eyes, and with a rapt ear- 
neſtneſs fixed them on the.heavens. She 
{till held the lute, hut no longer awaken- 
ed it, and ſeemed loſt for a moment, to 
every ſurrounding object. Her fine hair 
was negligently bound up in a filk net, 
and ſome treſſes that had eſcaped it, 
played on her neck, and round her beau- 
tiful countenance, which now was not 
even partially concealed by a veil. The 
light drapery of her dreſs, her whole 
figure, air, and attitude, were ſuch as 
might have been copied for a Grecian 
nymph. _ | . 

Vivaldi was perplexed and agitated be- 
tween the wiſh of ſeizing an opportunity, 
which might never again occur, of plead- 
ing his love, and the fear of offending, 
by intruding upon her retirement at fo 
ſacred an hour, While he thus heſitated, 
the placed herſelf in a chair, and, touching 


3 5 her 


o

Her lute in ſweet ſymphony, preſently 
accompanied it with her voice in a little 
air beautiful for its ſimplicity and pathos. 
When ſhe had concluded, he heard her 
ſigh, and then, with a ſweetneſs peculiar 
to her accent, pronounce his name. Dur- 
ing the trembling anxiety, with which 
he liſtened to what might follow this 
mention of his name, he diſturbed the 
clematis that ſurrounded the lattice, and 
the turned her eyes towards the window; 
but Vivaldi was entirely concealed by the 
foliage. She, however, roſe to cloſe the 
lattice ; when, as ſhe approached it, Vi- 
valdi, unable any longer to command 
himſelf, appeared before her. She ſtood 
fixed for an inſtant, while her counte- 
nance changed to an aſhy paleneſs ; and 
then, with trembling haſte cloſing the 
lattice, quitted the apartment. Vivaldi 
felt as if all his hopes had vaniſhed with 
her. 


After 


{&lt; 285 52 
Alter lingering in the garden for ſome 
time without perceiving a light in any 
=, other part of the building, or hearing a 
&gt; ſound proceed from it, he took his me- 


lancholy way to Naples. He now began 
to aſk himſelf ſome queſtions, which he 
= ought to have urged before, and to en- 


bt quire wherefore he ſought the dangerous 


pleaſure of ſecing Ellena, ſince her fa- 
mily was of ſuch a condition as rendered 
the conſent of his parents to a marriage 
with her unattainable. 

He was loſt in revery on this ſubject, 
ſometimes half refolved to ſeek her no 
more, and then ſhrinking from a con- 
duct, which ſeemed to ſtrike him with 
the force of deſpair, when, as he emerged 

from the dark arch of a ruin, that ex- 
tended over the road, his ſteps were 
croſſed by a perſon in the habit of a 
monk, whoſe face was ſhrouded by his 
cowl {till more than by the twilight. 
The ſtranger, addreſſing him by his

name, ſaid, © Signor! your ſteps are 
watched; beware how you reviſit Al- 
tieri!'“ Having uttered this, he diſap- 
peared, before Vivaldi could return 
the ſword he had half drawn into the 
ſcabbard, or demand an explanation of 
the words he had heard. He called 
loudly and repeatedly, conjuring the un- 
known perſon to appear, and lingered 
near the ſpot for'a conſiderable time ; 
but the viſion came no more. 

Vivaldi arrived at home with a mind 
occupied by this incident, and tormented 
by the jealouſy to which it gave riſe ; for, 
after indulging various conjeCtures, he 
concluded with believing the notice, of 
which he had been warned, to be that of 
a rival, and that the danger which me- 
naced him, was from the poniard of 
jealouſy. This belief diſcovered to him 
at once the extent of his paſſion, and of 
the imprudence, which had thus readily 
admitted it; yet ſo far was this new con- 

viction

vicdion from reſtraining his impetuolity, 


that, ſtung with a torture more exquiſite 
than he had ever known, he reſolved, 


at every event, to declare his love, and 


ſue for the hand of Ellena. Unhappy 
young man, he knew not the fatal er- 


* ror, into which paſſion was precipitating 


him ! | 
On his arrival at the Vivaldi palace, 


he learned that the Marcheſa had ob- 


ſerved his abſence, had repeatedly en- 
quired for him, and had given orders that 
the time of his return ſhould be men- 
tioned to her. She had, however, re- 
tired to reſt; but the Marcheſe, who 
had attended the King on an excurſion 
to one of the royal villas on the bay, did 
not return home till after Vincentio ; 
when he met his ſon with looks of un- 


uſual diſpleaſure, but avoided ſaying any 


thing, which either explained or alluded 
to the ſubje&amp; of it; and, after a ſhort 


converſation, they ſeparated. 


Vivaldi 


(9 

Vivaldi ſhut himſelf in his apartment 
to deliberate, if that may deſerve the 
name of deliberation, in which a conflict 
of paſſions, rather than an exertion of 
judgment, prevailed. For ſeveral hours 
he traverſed his ſuit of rooms, alternately 
tortured by the remembrance of Ellena, 
fired with jealouſy, and alarmed for the 
conſequence of the imprudent ſtep, 
which he was about to take. He knew 
the temper of his father, and ſome traits 
of the character of his mother, ſufficient- 
ly to fear that their diſpleaſure would be 
irreconcilable concerning the marriage he 
meditated; yet, when he conſidered that 
he was their only ſon, he was inclined to 
admit a hope of forgiveneſs, notwithſtand- 
ing the weight which the circumſtance 
muſt add to their diſappointment. Theſe 
reflexions were frequently interrupted by 
fears leſt Ellena had already diſpoſed of 
her affections to this imaginary rival. 
Te was, however, ſomewhat conſoled by 
remem- 


wh

remembering the ſigh ſhe had uttered, 
and the tenderneſs, with which ſhe had 

immediately pronounced his name. Yet, 

even if ſhe were not averſe to his ſuit, 

how could he ſolicit her hand, and hope 
it would be given him, when he ſhould 
declare that this muſt be in ſecret ? He 
© ſcarcely dared to believe that ſhe would 
*condeſcend to enter a family who were 
- unwilling to receive her; and again deſ- 
pondency overcame him. 


The morning found him as diſtracted 


as the night had left him; his determina- 
tion, however, was fixed; and this was, 

to ſacrifice what he now conſidered as a 
deluſive pride of birth, to a choice which 
he believed would enſure the happineſs 
of his life. But, before he ventured to 
declare himſelf to Ellena, it appeared ne- 
ceſſary to aſcertain whether he held an 
intereſt in her heart, or whether ſhe had 
deͤvoted it to the rival of his love, and 
* who this rival really was. It was ſo much 


eaſier 


(40) 


eaſier to wiſh for ſuch information than 
to obtain it, that, after forming a thou- 


ſand projects, either the delicacy of his 


reſpect for Ellena, or his fear of offend- 
ing her, or an apprehenſion of diſcovery 
from his family before he had ſecured an 
intereſt in her affections, conſtantly op- 
poſed his views of an enquiry. 

In this difficulty he opened his heart to 
a friend, who had long poſſeſſed his con- 
fidence, and whole advice he ſolicited 
with ſomewhat more anxiety and ſin- 
cerity than is uſual on ſuch occaſions. 
It was not a ſanction of his own opinion 
that he required, but the impartial judg- 
ment of another mind. Bonarmo, how- 
ever little he might be qualified for the 
office of an adviſer, did not ſcruple to 
give his advice. As a means of judging 
whether: Ellena was diſpoſed to favour 
Vivaldi's addreſſes, he propoſed: that, ac- 
cording to the: cuſtom of the country, a 
lerenade-ſhould be given; he maintained, 
9369 that, 


—— MR SI RD elf SI

that, if ſhe was not difinclined towards 
him, ſome ſign of approbation would ap- 
pear ; and if otherwiſe, that ſhe would 
remain filent and inviſible. Vivaldi ob- 
jected to this coarſe and inadequate mode 
of expreſſing a love ſo ſacred as his, and 
he had too lofty an opinion of Ellena's 
mind and delicacy, to believe, that the 
trifling homage of a ſerenade would either 
flatter her ſelf- love, or intereſt her in his 
favour; nor, if it did, could he venture to 
believe, that ſne would diſplay any ſign 


of approbation. . 
His friend laughed at his ſcruples and 


at his opinion of what he called ſuch 
romantic delicacy, that his ignorance of 
the world was his only excuſe for having 
cheriſhed them. But Vivaldi interrupted, 
this raillery, and would neither ſuffer him 


for a moment to ſpeak thus of Ellena, or 
to call ſuch delicacy romantic. Bo- 


Fi narmo, however, {till urged the ſerenade 
s atleaſt a poſſible means of diſcovering 


her 


„ 


het diſpoſition towards him before he 


made a formal avowal of his ſuit; and 4 
Vivaldi, perplexed and diſtracted with 


apprehenſion and impatience to terminate 
his preſent ſtate of ſuſpenſe, was at length 
ſo far overcome by his own difficulties, 


rather than by his friend's perſuaſion, 


that he conſented to make the adventure 
of a ſerenade on the approaching night. 
This was adopted rather as a refuge from 
deſpondency, than with a hope of ſucceſs ; 
for he ſtill believed that Ellena would not 
give any hint, which might terminate his 
uncertainty, 


Beneath their cloaks, when the da 


had cloſed, they carried muſical inſtru- 
ments, and, muffling up their faces, ſo 
that they could not be known, they pro- 
ceeded in thoughtful filence on the way 
to Villa Altieri, Already they had paſſed 
the arch, in which Vivaldi was ſtopped 
by the ſtranger on the preceding night, 
when he heard a ſudden ſound near him, 

and,

I., raiſing his head from his cloak, he 


perceived the ſame figure! Before he had 
time for exclamation, the ſtranger croſſed 


him again. “Go not to Villa Altieri,“ 
ſaid he in a ſolemn voice, © leſt you! meet 


he fate you ought to dread.” 


What fate?” demanded Vivaldi, 
| ſtepping back; © Speak, I conjure you !”? 
But the monk was gone, and the dark- 
pels of the hour baffled obſervation as to 


the way of his departure. 
Dio mi guardi. &gt;? exclaimed Bc nar- 


mo, this is almoſt beyond belief | but 


let us return to Naples; this ſecond warns 


ing ought to be obeyed.” 


It is almoſt beyond endurance,” ex- 


claimed Vivaldi; which way did he 


'paſs 7??? 
« He glided by me,” replied Bonar- 
mo, and he was gone before I could 


| croſs him! 


I will tempt the worſt at once,” ſaid 
Vivaldi; © if I have a rival, it is beſt to 


7 meet im, Let us go on,” 


Bonarmo 


(3&amp;3 


Bonarmo remonſtrated, and repreſent- 
ed the ſerious danger that threatened 
from ſo raſh a proceeding. It is evi- 
dent that you have a rival,” faid he; 
* and your courage cannot avail you 
againſt hired bravos.“ Vivaldi's heart 
ſwelled at the mention of a rival. If 
you think it dangerous to proceed, I 
will go alone,” he rejoined. 

Hurt by this reproof, Bonarmo accom- 
panied his friend in filence, and they 
reached without interruption the bound- 
ary of the villa. Vivaldi led to the place 
by which he had entered on the preceding 
night, and they paſſed unmoleſted into 
the garden, | 

Where are theſe terrible bravos of 
whom you warned me?” ſaid Vivaldi, 
with taunting exultation. 

“Speak cautiouſly,” replied his friend; 
&amp; we may, even now, be within their 
reach.“ 

They alſo may be within ours, ob- 
ſerved Vivaldi.

| f At length theſe adventurous friends 


came to the orangery, which was near the 
houſe, when, tired by the aſcent, they 
reſted to recover breath, and to prepare 
their inſtruments for the ſerenade. The 
night was ſtill, and they now heard, for 
che firſt time, murmurs as of a diſtant 


multitude ; and then the ſudden ſplendor 


of fireworks broke upon the ſky. Theſe 
aroſe from a villa on the weſtern margin 
of the bay, and were given in honour of 
the birth of one of the royal princes. 
They foared to an immenſe height, and, 
as their luſtre broke ſilently upon the 


night, it lightened on the thouſand up- 


turned faces of the gazing crowd, illu- 


mined the waters of the bay, with all 


the ſhipping, and every little boat that 
ſkimmed its ſurface, and ſhewed diſtinctly 
the whole ſweep of its riſing ſhores, the 
ſtately city- of Naples on the ftrand be- 


lou, and, ſpreading far among the hills, 


its terraced roofs crowded with ſpectators, 


„ 


and the Corſo tumultuous with carriages 
and blazing with torches. 

While Bonarmo ſurveyed this magni- 

ficent ſcene, Vivaldi turned his eyes to 
the refidence of Ellena, part of which 
looked out from among the trees, with a 
hope that the ſpectacle would draw her to 
a balcony; but ſhe did not appear, nor 
was there any light, that might indicate 
her approach. 
While they ſtill reſted on the 156 df 
the orangery, they. heard a ſudden ruſt- 
ling of the leaves, as if the branches were 
diſturbed by ſome perſon who endea- 
voured to make his way between them, 
when Vivaldi demanded who paſſed. No 
anſwer was returned, and a long ſilence 
followed. | 

« We are obſerved,” ſaid Bonarmo, 
at length, „and are even now, perhaps, 
almoſt beneath the poniard of the aſſaſſin: 
let us be gone.”

little to intereſt you, ſince your thoughts 
have {6 much leiſure for apprehenſion.” 
„My fear is that of prudence, not of

mony; © you will find, perhaps, that I

While this converſation paſſed, they 
had quitted the orangery, and reached 
the walls of the villa, where they took 
their ſtation under a balcony that over- 
hung the lattice, through which Vivaldi 
had ſeen Ellena on the preceding night. 
They tuned their inſtruments, and open- 
ed the ſerenade with a duet. 

Vivaldi's voice was a fine tenor, and 
the ſame ſuſceptibility, which made him 
paſſionately fond of muſic, taught him to 
modulate its cadence with exquiſite deli- 
cacy, and to give his emphaſis with the 
moſt ſimple and pathetic expreſſion. His 
foul ſeemed to breathe in the ſounds,— 
ſo tender, ſo imploring, yet fo energetic. 
On this night, enthuſiaſm inſpired him 
with the higheſt eloquence, perhaps, 
which muſic is capable of attaining ; 
what might be its effect on Ellena he had 
no means of judging, for ſhe did not ap-

nor gave any hint of applauſe. No ſounds 
Mole on the ſtillneſs of the night, except 


thoſe of the ſerenade, nor did any light 
from within the villa break upon the ob- 


curity without; once, indeed, in a pauſe 


of the inſtruments, Bonarmo fancied he 


diſtinguiſhed voices near him, as of per- 


ions who feared to be heard, and he 
liſtened attentively, but without aſcer- 
Ftaining the truth. Sometimes they ſeemed 
to ſound heavily in his ear, and then a 
death: like filence prevailed. Vivaldi af. 
timed the ſound to be nothing more than 
£ the confuſed murmur of the diſtant mul- 
titude on the ſhore, but Bonarmo was not

for the conſequence of his deſpair, was as

rival, as he had lately been pertinacious 
in affirming that he had one. 
At length, they left the gardens, Vi- 
valdi proteſting that he would not reſt

who ſo wantonly deſtroyed his peace, 
and had compelled him to explain his 
ambiguous warnings ; and Bonarmo re-

ment, where moſt he dreaded it ſhould

They had remained watchful and ſtill

arch-way . neareſt to Altieri. He heard 
ho ſtep, but he perceived a ſhadowy fi- 
ure ſtation itſelf at the entrance of the 
arch, where the twilight of this brilliant 
climate was, for a few paces, admitted. 
Vivaldi's eyes were fixed on the road 
leading towards Naples, and he, there- 
fore, did not perceive the object of Bo- 
narmo's attention, who, fearful of his 
friend's precipitancy, forbore to point out 
immediately what he obſerved, judging 
it more prudent to watch the motions of 
this unknown perſon, that he might aſ- 
certain whether it really were the monk. 
The ſize of the figure, and the dark 


75 drapery in which it ſeemed wrapt, in- 
duced him, at length, to believe that 
this was the expected ſtranger; and he

ſeized Vivaldi's arm to direct his atten- 
tion to him, when the form gliding for- 


ward diſappeared in the gloom of the 


arch, but not before Vivaldi had under- 
ſtood the occaſion of his friend's geſture 
and ſignificant ſilence. They heard no 


footſtep paſs them, and, being convinced 


that this perſon, whatever he was, had 
not left the arch-way, they kept their 
ſtation in watchful ſtillneſs. Preſently 
they heard a ruſtling, as of garments, 
near them, and Vivaldi, unable longer to 
command his impatience, ſtarted from his 
concealment, and, with arms extended to 
prevent any one from eſcaping, demand- 
ed who was there. | 

The ſound ceaſed, and no reply was 
made. Bonarmo drew his ſword, pro- 
teſting he would ſtab the air till he found 
the perſon who lurked there ; but that it 
the latter would diſcover himſelf, he 


ſhould receive no injury. This aſſurance 
Vivaldi confirmed by his promiſe, Still

he began to aſcend. 


“Stop, for Heaven's ſake, ſtop!“ ſaid 
Bonarmo ; © conſider what you are 


about! Do not brave the utter darkneſs 


of theſe ruins ; do not purſue the aſſaſſin

Vivaldi, ſtill aſcending ; © he ſhall not

Bonarmo pauſed a moment at the foot

ſuffering him to encounter danger alone, 
he ſprang to the flight, and not with.

ſteps. 


Having reached the ſummit of the | 


rock, he found himſelf on a terrace, that 
ran along the top of the arch-way and 
had once been fortified ; this, crofling the 
road, commanded the defile each way. 
Some remains of maſſy walls, that till 
exhibited loops-for archers, were all that 
now hinted of its former uſe. It led to a 
watch-tower almoſt. concealed in thick 
pines, that crowned the oppoſite cliff, 
and had thus ſerved not only for a ſtrong 


battery over the road, but, connecting 


the oppoſite fides of the defile, had form- 
ed a line of communication between the 
fort and this out. poſt. |

Bonarmo looked round in vain for his 
friend, and the echoes of his own voice 
© only, among the rocks, replied to his re- 
peated calls. After ſome heſitation whe- 
ther to enter the walls of the main build- 
ing, or to croſs to the watch-tower, he 
determined on the former, and entered 


ga rugged area, the walls of which, fol- 


* lowing the declivities of the precipice, 
* could ſcarcely now be traced. The

= once important fortreſs ; except, indeed, 
a a maſs of ruins near the edge of the 

cliff, the conſtruction of which made it 


difficult to gueſs for what purpoſe it had 


$ 50 been deſigned. 


Bonarmo entered the immenſe walls 
of the citadel, but the utter darkneſs 
within checked his progreſs, and con- 
tenting himſelf with calling loudly on 
Vivaldi, he returned to the open air.

As he approached the maſs of ruin, 
whoſe ſingular form had intereſted his 
curioſity, he thought he diſtinguiſhed the 
low accents of a human voice, and while 
he liſtened in anxiety, a perſon ruſhed 
forth from a doorway of the ruin, carry- 
ing a drawn ſword. It was Vivaldi 
himſelf. Bonarmo ſprang to meet him; 
he was pale and breathleſs, and fome mo-

appeared to hear the repeated enquiries 
of his friend.

have you ſeen, that you are thus af,

« Aſk me no more queſtions, let us

ſeemed reluctant to ſatisfy, and won-

Vivaldi; „J am more perplexed than

faid Vivaldi; © but be it as it may, the 
buſineſs reſts not here. I will return in 
the night of to-morrow with a torch ;

TwELFTH NIGHT. 


Sion Vivaldi had failed to procure 
an explanation of the words of the 
monk, he determined to relieve himſelf 
from the tortures of ſuſpenſe, reſpecting 
a rival, by going to Villa Altieri, and de- 
claring his pretenſions. On the morn- 
ing immediately following his late adven- 
ture, he went thither, and on enquiring 
for Signora Bianchi, was told that ſhe 
could not be ſeen, With much diffi- 
culty 


( 68 ) 


culty he prevailed upon the old houſe- 


keeper to deliver a requeſt that he might 
be permitted to wait upon her for a few 
moments. Permiſſion was granted him, 
when he was conducted into the very 
apartment where he had formerly ſeen 
Ellena. It was unoccupied and he was 
told that Signora Bianchi would be there 

preſently. Si 
During this interval, he was agitated 
at one. moment with quick impatience, 
and at another with enthuſiaſtic pleaſure, 
while he gazed on the altar whence he had 
ſeen Ellena riſe, and w here, to his fancy, 
ſhe ſtill appeared ; and on every object, 
on which he knew her eyes had lately 
dwelt. Theſe objects, ſo familiar to her, 
had in the imagination of Vivaldi ac- 
quired ſomewhat of the ſacred character 
ſhe had impreſſed upon his heart, and 
affected him i in ſome degree as her pre- 
ſence would have done. He trembled as 
he took up the ute ſhe had been ac- 
cuſtomed

cuſtomed to touch, and, when he awaken- 
ed the chords, her own voice ſeemed to 
ſpeak. A drawing, half finiſhed, of a 
dancing nymph remained on a ſtand, and 
he immediately underſtood that her hand 
had traced the lines. It was a copy 
from Herculaneum, and, though a copy, 
was touched with the ſpirit of origin- 
genius. The light ſteps appeared almoſt 
to move, and the whole figure diſplayed 
the airy lightneſs of exquiſite grace. Vi- 


valdi perceived this to be one of a ſet 
that ornamented the apartment, and ob- 


ſerved with ſurpriſe, that they were the 
particular ſubjects, which adorned his fa- 


ther's cabinet, and which he had under- 


ſtood to be the only copies permitted 


from the originals i in the Royal Muſeum. 
"Every object, on which his eyes reſted, 
ſeemed to announce the preſence of El- 


lena; and the very flowers that ſo gaily 
embelliſned the apartment, breathed forth 


a perfume, which faſcinated his ſenſes and

affected his imagination. Before Signora 80 
Bianchi appeared, his anxiety and appre- 5 
henſion had encreaſed ſo much, that, be- 
lieving he ſhould be unable to ſupport 
himſelf in her preſence, he was more 
than once upon the point of leaving the, 
houſe. At length, he heard her ap- 
proaching ſtep from the hall, and his 


breath almoſt forſook him. The figure 
of Signora Bianchi was not of an order 
to inſpire admiration, and a ſpectator 
might have ſmiled to ſee the perturbation 
of Vivaldi, his faltering ſtep and anxious 
eye, as he advanced to meet this vene- 
rable lady, as he bowed upon her faded 
hand, and liſtened to her querulous voice. 
She received him with an air of reſerve, 
and ſome moments paſſed before he could 
recollect himſelf ſufficiently to explain 
the purpoſe of his viſit; yet this, when 
he diſcovered it, did not apparently ſur- 
priſe her. She liſtened with compoſure, 
though with ſomewhat of a ſevere

countenance, to his proteſtations of re- 
gard for her niece; and when he unplored 
her to intercede for him in obtaining the 
hand of Ellena, ſhe ſaid, © I cannot be 
ignorant that a family of your rank muſt 
be averſe to an union with one of mine; 
nor am I unacquainted that a full ſenſe 
of the value of birth is a marking feature 
in the characters of the Marcheſe and 
Marcheſa di Vivaldi. This propoſal muſt 


be difagreeable or, at leaſt, unknown to 


them; and I am to inform you, Signor, 
that, though Signora di Roſalba is their 
inferior in rank, ſhe is their equal in 
pride.“ 
Vivaldi diſdained to prevaricate, yet 
was ſhocked to own the truth thus 
abruptly. The ingenuous manner, how- 
ever, with which he at length did this, 
and the energy of a paſſion too eloquent 
to be miſunderſtood, ſomewhat ſoothed 
the anxiety of Bianchi, with whom other 


conſiderations began to ariſe. She con- 
ſidered

ſidered that from her own age and in- 


firmities ſhe muſt very ſoon, in the courſe 


of nature, leave Ellena a young and 
friendleſs orphan ; ſtill ſomewhat de- 
pendent upon her own induſtry, and en- 
tirely ſo on her diſcretion. With much 
beauty and little knowledge of the world, 


the dangers of her future ſituation ap- 


peared in vivid colours to the affectionate 
mind of Signora Bianchi; and ſhe ſome- 
times thought that it might be right to 
ſacrifice conſiderations, which in other 
circumſtances would be laudable, to the 


obtaining for her niece the protection of 


a huſband and a man of honour. If in 
this inſtance ſhe deſcended from the lofty 
integrity, which ought to have oppoſed 
her conſent that Ellena ſhould clandeſ- 


tinely enter any family, a conſideration of 


her parental anxiety may ſoften the cen- 

ſure the deſerved. 

But, before ſhe determined upon this 
ſubje&amp;, it was neceſſary to aſcertain that 

Vivaldi

He remained at Portici the following

brought a refuſal to accompany him to

dangerous a viſit. Being for this night 
unprovided with a companion for the ad-

from viſiting Villa Altieri. Not chuſing

In the ſouth-eaſt the outline of Veſuvius 
appeared diſtinctly, but the mountain it- 
ſelf was dark and ſilent. 

Vivaldi heard only the quick and eager 
voices of ſome Lazaroni at a diſtance on 
the ſhore, as they contended at the ſimple 
game of morra. From the bowery lat- 
tices of a ſmall pavilion within the 
orangery, he perceived a light, and the 
ſudden hope, which it occaſioned, of ſee- 
ing Ellena, almoſt overcame him. It 
was impoſſible to reſiſt the opportunity 
of beholding her, yet he checked the im- 
patient ſtep he was taking, to aſk him- 
ſelf, whether it was honorable thus to 
ſteal upon her retirement, and become 
an unſuſpeted obſerver of her ſecret 
thoughts. -But the temptation was too 
powerful for this honorable heſitation ; 
the pauſe was momentary ; and ſtepping 
lightly towards the pavilion, he placed 
himſelf near an open lattice, ſo as to be

full view of the apartment. Ellena was 


one, ſitting in a thoughtful attitude and 


holding her lute, which ſhe did not play. 
She appeared loſt to a conſciouſneſs of ſur- 
rounding objects, and a tenderneſs was 
on her countenance, which ſeemed to tell 
kim that her thoughts were engaged by 
ſome intereſting ſubjeQ. Recolleting 
that, when laſt he had ſeen her thus, ſhe 
pronounced his name, his hope revived,

“% Oh, never, never!“ interrupted El. 


lena, impatiently; “ forget that I ever 
made ſuch acknowledgment ; forget that 


you ever heard it; I knew not what I 


W ſaid.” 


Ah, beautiful Ellena! do you think 


it poſſible I ever can forget it? It will be 


the ſolace of my ſolitary hours, the hope 


that ſhall ſuſtain me.“ 


I cannot be detained, Signor,“ inter- 


1 rupted Ellena, ſtill more embarraſſed, 
is or forgive myſelf for having permitted 
ſuch a converſation ;” but as ſhe ſpoke 
the laſt words, an involuntary ſmile ſeem- 


ed to contradict their meaning. Vivaldi 
n 4 believed 


(- 00 3 

believed the ſmile in ſpite of the words; ; 

but, before he could expreſs the lightning 

joy of conviction, ſhe had left the pavi- 
lion; he followed through the garden— 
but ſhe was gone. 1 

From this moment Vivaldi ſeemed to 
have ariſen into a new exiſtence ; the 
whole world to him was Paradiſe; that 
ſmile ſeemed impreſſed upon his heart 
for ever. In the fulneſs of preſent joy, 
he believed it impoſſible that he could 
ever be unhappy again, and defied the 
utmoſt malice of future fortune, With 
footſteps light as air, he returned to 
Naples, nor once remembered to look for 
his old monitor on the way. 

The Marcheſe and his mother being 
from home, he was left at his leiſure to 
indulge the rapturous recollection, that 
preſſed upon his mind, and of which he 
was impatient of a moment's interrup- 
tion. All night he either traverſed his 
apartment with an agitation equal to that 

which 


( 81 ) 
which anxiety had ſo lately inflicted, or 
compoſed and deſtroyed letters to Ellena ; 
ſometimes fearing that he had written too 
much, and at others feeling that he had 
written too little; recollecting circum- 
ſtances which he ought to have mention- 
ed, and lamenting the cold expreſſion of 


a paſhon, to which it appeared that no 
language could do juſtice. 


By the hour when the domeſtics had 
riſen, he had, however, completed a let- 
ter ſomewhat more to his ſatis faction, and 
he diſpatched it to Villa Altieri by a con- 
fidential perſon; but the fervant had 
ſcarcely quitted the gates, when he recol- 
lected new arguments, which he wiſhed 
to urge, and expreſſions to change of the 
utmoſt importance to enforce his mean- 
ing, and he would have given half the 
world to have recalled the meſſenger. 

In this ſtate of agitation he was ſum- 
moned to attend the Marcheſe, who had 
been too much engaged of late to keep 

D 5 his 


(98-7 

his own appointment. Vivaldi was not 
long in doubt as to the ſubject of this in- 

terview. | 
“ I have wiſhed to ſpeak with you,” 
ſaid the Marcheſe, aſſuming an air of 
haughty ſeverity, upon a ſubject of the 
utmoſt importance to your honour and 
happineſs; and I wiſhed, alſo, to give 
you an opportunity of contradicting a 
report, which would have occaſioned me 
conſiderable uneaſineſs, if I could have 
believed it. Happily I had too much 
confidence in my ſon to credit this; 
and I affirmed that he underſtood too 
well what was due both to his family and 
himſelf, to take any ſtep derogatory from 
the dignity of either. My motive for 
this converſation, therefore, is merely to 
afford you a moment for refuting the 
calumny I ſhall mention, and to obtain 
for myſelf authority for contradicting it 
to the perſons who have communicated 

it to me,” ASHE 
Vivaldi

Vivaldi waited impatiently for the con- 
eluſion of this exordium, and then begged 
to be informed of the ſubject of the re- 
port. | 

ce It is ſaid,” reſumed the Marcheſe, 
« that there is a young woman, who is 
called Ellena Roſalba,.—I think that is 
the name ;—do you know any perſon of 
the name? | 

«© Do I know!” exclaimed Vivaldi, 
but pardon me; pray proceed, my 
Lord.“ 

The Marcheſe pauſed, and regarded 
his ſon with ſternneſs, but without ſur— 
prize. It is ſaid, that a young perſon 
of this name has contrived to faſcinate 
your affections, and'—— 

&lt; It is moſt true, my Lord, that Signora 
Roſalba has won my affections,” inter- 
rupted Vivaldi with honeſt impatience, 
* but without contrivance.”” 

I will not be interrupted,” ſaid the- 
Marcheſ, interrupting in his turn. © It

is faid that ſhe has fo artfully adapted her 
temper to yours, that, with the aſſiſtance 
of a relation who lives with her, ſhe has 
reduced you to the degrading fituation of 
her devoted ſuitor.” 

„Signora Roſalba, my Lord, has not 
yet allowed me to aſſume that honourable 
title, faid Vivaldi, unable longer to com- 
mand his feelings. He was proceeding 
when the Marcheſe again checked him : 
« You avow your folly then!“ 

„My Lord, I glory in my choice.“ 

„ Young man,” rejoined his father, 
das this is the arrogance and romantic 
enthuſiaſm of a boy, I am willing to for- 
give it for once, and obſerve me, only for 
once. If you will acknowledge your 
error, and inftanily diſiniſs this new fa- 
vourite,”” — 

„My Lord!“ 

« You mult inſtantly diſmiſs her,“ re- 
peated the Marcheſe with ſterner em- 
phaſis ; „and, to prove that I am more 

mercifu] 


( 3-3 
merciful than juſt, I am willing, on this 
condition, to allow her a ſmall annuity 
as ſome reparation for the depravity, 
into which you have aſſiſted to fink her.“ 
„My Lord!” exclaimed Vivaldi aghaſt, 
and ſcarcely daring to truſt his voice, 
« my Lord !—depravity ?“ ſtruggling 
for breath. © Who has dared to pollute 
her ſpotleſs fame by inſulting your ears 
with ſuch infamous falſehood ? Tell me, 
I conjure you, inſtantly tell me, that I

* Young man, ſaid the Marcheſe, 
- who had obſerved the violence of his 


emotion with ſtrong diſpleaſure and alarm,

my authority, and tear the veil from your 
eyes. Diſmiſs her inſtantly, and I will 
adduce proof of her former character 
which will ſtagger even your faith, en- 
thuſiaſtic as it is.“ 

«© Diſmiſs her!“ repeated Vivaldi, with 
calm yet ſtern energy, ſuch as his father 
had never ſeen him aſſume ; © My Lord, 
you have never yet doubted my word, 
and I now pledge you that honourable 
word, that Ellena 1s innocent. Inno- 
cent! O Heavens, that it ſhould ever be 
neceſſary to affirm ſo, and, above all, 
that it ſhould ever be neceſſary for me to 
vindicate her!“ 

« I muſt indeed lament that it ever 
ſhould,” replied the Marcheſe coldly. 
« You have pledged your word, which I 
cannot queſtion. I beheve, therefore, 
that you are deceived ; that you think 
her virtuous, notwithſtanding your mid- 


night viſits to her houſe, And grant ſhe

you make her for the infatuated folly, 
which has thus ſtained her character? 
What“ 

« By proclaiming to the world, my 
Lord, that ſhe is worthy of becoming my 
wife,“ replied Vivaldi, with a glow of 

countenance, which announced the cou- 
rage and the exultation of a virtuous 
mind. Wet 
B &amp; Your wife!“ ſaid the Marcheſe, with 
a look of ineffable difdain, which was in- 
ſtantly ſucceeded by one of angry alarm. 
2 If I believed you could ſo far forget 
ZZ what is due to the honour of your houſe, 
I would for ever diſclaim you as my ſon.” 

O! why,” exclaimed Vivaldi, in an 
agony of conflicting paſſions, ** why 
ſhould I be in danger of forgetting what 
is due to a father, when I am only aſſert- 
ing what is due to innocence ; when 1 

am only defending her, who has no other 
to defend her! Why may not I be per- 
| mitted 


( 88. ) 


mitted to reconcile duties ſo congenial! 
But, be the event what it may, I will de- 
fend the oppreſſed, and glory in the vir- 
tue, which teaches me, that it is the firſt 
duty of humanity to do ſo. Yes, my 
Lord, if it muſt be ſo, I am ready to ſa- 
crifice inferior duties to the grandeur of 
a principle, which ought to expand all 
hearts and impel all actions. I ſhall beſt 
ſupport the honour of my houſe by ad- 
hering to its dictates.“ 

« Where is the principle, ſaid the 
Marcheſe, impatiently, „which ſhall 
teach you to diſobey a father; where is 
the virtue which ſhall inſtruct you to de- 
grade your family ?” 

There can be no degradation, my 
Lord, where there is no vice,” replied 
Vivaldi; © and there are inſtances, par- 
don me, my Lord, there are ſome few 
inſtances in which it is virtuous to diſ- 
obey even a parent.“

Co 

&amp;« This paradoxical morality,” ſaid the 
Marcheſe, with encreaſed diſpleaſure, 
« and this romantic language, ſufficient- 
ly explain to me the character of your 
aſſociates, and the innocence of her, 
whom you defend with ſo chivalric an 
air. Are you to learn, Signor, that you 
belong to your family, not your family 
to you ; that you are only a guardian of 
its honour, and not at liberty to diſpoſe 
of yourſelf? My patience will endure no 
more!“ 

Nor could the patience of Vivaldi en- 
dure this repeated attack on the honor 
of Ellena. But, while he yet aſſerted her 
innocence, he endeavoured to do ſo with 
the temper, which was due to the pre- 
ſence of a father; and, though he main. 
tained the independence of a man, he 
was equally anxious to preſerve inviolate 
the duties of a ſon. But unfortunately 
the Marcheſe and Vivaldi differed in opi- 
nion concerning the limits of theſe duties; 

| the 


6-0-2 
the firſt extending them to paſſive obe- 
clience, and the latter conceiving them to 
conclude at a point, wherein the happi- 
neſs of an individual is ſo deeply con- 
cerned as in marriage. They parted 
mutually inflamed ; Vivaldi unable to 
prevail with his father to mention the 
name of his infamous informant, or to 
acknowledge himſelf convinced of El- 
lena's innocence; and the Marcheſe 
equally unſucceſsful in his endeavours to 
obtain from his ſon a promiſe that he 
would ſee her no more. 

Here then was - Vivaldi, who only a 
few ſhort hours before had experienced a 
happineſs ſo ſupreme as to efface all im- 
preſſions of the paſt, and to annihilate 
every conſideration of the future; a joy 
ſo full that it permitted him not to be- 
lieve it poſſible that he could ever again 
taſte of miſery ; he, who had felt as if that 
moment was as an eternity, rendering 
him independent of all others, — even he 


Was 


00-3 


was thus ſoon fallen into the region of 
time and of ſuffering ! 

The preſent conflict of paſſion appeared 
= cndleſs ; he loved his father, and would 
4 have been more ſhocked to conſider the 
W vexation he was preparing for him, had 
he not been reſentful of the contempt he 
expreſſed for Ellena, He adored Ellena, 
and, while, he felt the impracticability of 
reſigning his hopes, was equally indignant 
of the ſlander, which affected her name, 
= and impatient to avenge the inſult upon 
the original defamer. 

Though the diſpleaſure of the Marcheſe 
concerning a marriage with Ellena had 
been already foreſeen, the experience of 
it was ſeverer and more painful than Vi. 
valdi had imagined ; while the indignity 
offered to Ellena was as unexpected as 
intolerable. But this circumſtance fur- 
nithed him with an additional argument 
for addreſſing her; for, if it had been 
poſſible that his love could have pauſed, 
his 


(---92-- 


his honour ſeemed now engaged in her 
behalf; and, fince he had been a means 
of ſullying her fame, it became his duty 
to reſtore it. Willingly liſtening to the 
dictates of a duty ſo plauſible, he deter- 
mined to perſevere in his onginal deſign. 
But his firſt efforts were directed to diſ- 
cover her ſlanderer, and recollecting, 
with ſurprize, thoſe words of the Mar- 
cheſe, which had confeſſed a knowledge 
of his evening viſits to Villa Altieri, the 
doubtful warnings of the monk ſeemed 
explained. He ſuſpected that this man 
was at once the ſpy of his ſteps, and the 
defamer of his love, till the inconſiſtency 
of ſuch conduct with the ſeeming friend- 
lineſs of his admonitions, ſtruck Vivaldi 
and compelled him to believe the con- 
trary, 

Meanwhile, the heart of Ellena had 
been little leſs tranquil, It was divided 
by love and pride ; but had ſhe been ac- 
quainted with the circumſtances of the 

late 


5 


late interview between the Marcheſe and 
Vivaldi, it would have been divided no 
longer, and a juſt regard for her own 
dignity would inſtantly have taught her 
to ſubdue, without difficulty, this infant 
affection. 

Signora Bianchi had informed her niece 
of the ſubject of Vivaldi's viſit; but ſhe 
had ſoftened the objectionable circum- 
ſtances that attended his propoſal, and 
had, at firſt, merely hinted that it was 
not to be ſuppoſed his family would ap- 
prove of a connection with any perſon ſo 
much their inferior in rank as herſelf. 
FEllena, alarmed by this ſuggeſtion, re- 
plwied, that, ſince ſhe believed ſo, ſhe had 
done right to reject Vivaldi's ſuit ; but 
her ſigh, as ſhe faid this, did not eſcape 


the obſervation of Bianchi, who ventured 


to add, that ſhe had not ab/olutely rejected 
his offers. 

Z Whilein this and future converſations, 
&gt; Ellena was pleaſed to perceive her ſecret

| ( 94 ) 
admiration thus juſtified by an approba- 
tion ſo indiſputable as that of her aunt, 
and was willing to believe that the cir- 
cumſtance, which had alarmed her juſt 
pride, was not ſo humiliating as ſhe at 
firſt imagined, Bianchi was careful to 
conceal the real conſiderations, which had 
induced her to liſten to Vivaldi, being 
well aſſured that they would have no 
weight with Ellena, whoſe generous 
heart and inexperienced mind would have 
revolted from mingling any motives oi 
intereſt with an engagement ſo ſacred as 
that of marriage. When, however, 
from farther deliberation upon the ad- 
vantages, which ſuch an alliance muſt 
ſecure for her niece, Signora Bianchi de- 
termined to encourage his views, and to 
direct the mind of Ellena, whoſe affections 
were already engaged on her ſide, the 
opinions of the latter were found leſs 
ductile than had been expected. She

deſtinely the family of Vivaldi. But 


Bianchi, whoſe infirmities urged her 
wiſhes, was now ſo ſtrongly convinced 
of the prudence of ſuch an engagement 
for her niece, that ſhe determined to pre- 
vail over her reluctance, though ſhe per- 
ceived that this muſt be by means more 
gradual and periuaſive than ſhe had be- 
lieved neceſſary. On the evening, when 
Vivaldi had ſurpriſed from Ellena an ac- 
knowledgment of her ſentiments, her em- 
barraſſment and vexation, on her return- 
ing to the houſe, and relating what had 
occurred, ſufficiently expreſſed to Signora 
Bianchi the exact ſituation of her heart. 
And when, on the following morning, 
his letter arrived, written with the fam- 
plicity and energy of truth, the aunt 
neglected not to adapt her remarks upon 
it, to the character of Ellena, with her 

uſual addreſs. - 
Vivaldi, after the late interview with 
the Marcheſe, paſſed the remainder of the

day in conſidering various plans, which 
might diſcover to him the perſon, who 
had abuſed the credulity of his father ; 
and in the evening he returned once 
more to Villa Altieri, not in ſecret, to 
ſerenade the dark balcony of his miſtreſs, 
but openly, and to converſe with Signora 
Bianchi, who now received him more 
courteouſly than on his former viſit. At- 
tributing the anxiety in his countenance 
to the uncertainty concerning the dil- 
poſition of her niece, ſhe was neither 
{ſurpriſed or offended, but ventured to re- 
lieve him from a part of it, by en- 
couraging his hopes. Vivaldi dreaded 
leſt ſhe ſhould enquire further reſpecting 
the ſentiments of his family, but ſhe 
ſpared both his delicacy and her own on 
this point ; and, after a converſation of 
conſiderable length, he left Altieri with 
a heart ſomewhat ſoothed by approba- 
tion, and lightened by hope, although he 
had not obtained a ſight of Ellena. The

diſcloſure ſhe had made of her ſentiments 
on the preceding evening, and the hints 
ſhe had received as to thoſe of his fa- 
mily, wrought upon her mind with too 
much effect to permit an interview. 

Soon after his return to Naples, the 
Marcheſa, whom he was ſurpriſed to ſind 
diſengaged, ſent for him to her cloſet, 
where a ſcene paſſed ſimilar to that which 
had occurred with his father, except 
that the Marcheſa was more dexterous 
in her queſtions, and more ſabtle in her 
whole conduct; and that Vivaldi, never 
for a moment, forgot the decorum, which 
was due to a mother. Managing his 
paſſions, rather than exaſperating them, 
and deceiving him with reſpect to ſhe de- 
gree of reſentment ſhe felt from his 
choice, ſhe was leſs paſſionate than the 
Marcheſe in her obſervations and remon- 
ſtrances, perhaps, only becauſe ſhe enter- 
tained more hope than he did of pre- 
venting the evil ſhe contemplated.

Vivaldi quitted her, unconvinced by 
her arguments, unſubdued by her pro- 
phecies, and unmoved in his deſigns. 
He was not alarmed, becauſe he did not 
ſufficiently underſtand her character to 
apprehend her purpoſes. Deſpairing to 
effect theſe by open violence, ſhe called 
in an auxiliary of no mean talents, and 
whoſe character and views well adapted 
him to be an inſtrument in her hands, 
It was, perhaps, the baſeneſs of her own 
heart, not either depth of reflexion or 
keenneſs of penetration, which enabled 
her to underſtand the nature of his ; and 
ſhe determined to modulate that nature to 


her own views. 


There lived in the Dominican convent 


of the Santo Spirito, at Naples, a man 


called father Schedoni; an Italian, as his 


name imported, but whoſe family was un- 
known, and from ſome circumſtances, it 
appeared, that he wiſhed to throw an im- 


penetrable veil over his origin, For what-

ever reaſon, he was never heard to men- 
tion a relative, or the place of his nativity, 
and he had artfully eluded every enquiry 
that approached the ſubje&amp;, which the 
curioſity of his aſſociates had occaſionally 


prompted. There were circumſtances, 
however, which ſeemed to indicate him 


a man of birth, and of fallen fortune; 


his ſpirit, as it had ſometimes looked 
forth from under the diſguiſe of his 
manners, appeared lofty ; it ſhewed not, 
however, the aſpirings of a generous 
mind, but rather the gloomy pride of a 
diſappointed one. Some few perſons in 
the convent, who had been intereſted by 
his appearance, believed that the pecu- 
liarities of his manners, his ſevere reſerve 
and unconquerable filence, his ſolitary 
habits and frequent penances, were the

of ſome hideous crime gnawing upon an 
awakened conſcience. 
He would ſometimes abſtract himſelf 
from the ſociety for whole days together, 
or when with ſuch a diſpoſition he was 
compelled to mingle with it, he ſeemed 
unconſcious where he was, and continued 
throuded in meditation and ſilence till he 
was again alone. There were times when 
it was unknown whither he had retired, 
notwithſtanding that his ſteps had been 
watched, and his cuſtomary haunts ex- 
amined. No one ever heard him com- 
plain. The elder brothers of the convent 
ſaid that he had talents, but denied him 
learning ; they applauded-him for the 
profound ſubtlety, which he occaſionally 
diſcovered in argument, but obſerved that 
he ſeldom perceived truth when it lay on 
the furface ; he could follow it through 
all the labyrinths of diſquiſition, but 
overlooked it, when it was undiſguiſed 
before 


E 


before him. In fact he cared not for 
truth, nor ſought it by bold and broad 
argument, but loved to exert the wily 
cunning of his nature in hunting it 
through artificial perplexities. At length, 
from a habit of intricacy and ſuſpicion, 
his vitiated mind could receive nothing 
for truth, which was fimple and eaſily 
comprehended. 

Among his aſſociates no one loved 
him, many diſliked him, and more feared. 
him. His figure was ſtriking, but not 
ſo from grace; it was tall, and, though 
extremely thin, his limbs were large and 
yacouth, and as he ſtalked along, wrapt 
in the black garments of his order, there 
was ſomething terrible in its air ; ſome- 
thing almoſt ſuperhuman, His cowl, 
too, as it threw a ſhade over the livid 
| paleneſs of his face, encreaſed its ſevere 

character, and gave an effect to his large 
melancholy eye, which approached to 
horror. His was not the melancholy of 

E 3 a ſen- 


( 102 ) 


a ſenſible and wounded heart, but ap- 
parently that of a gloomy and ferocious 
diſpoſition. There was ſomething in his 
phyſiognomy extremely ſingular, and that 
cannot eaſily be defined. It bore the 
traces of many paſſions, which ſeemed to 
have fixed the features they no longer 
animated. An habitual gloom and ſe- 
verity prevailed over the deep lines of 
his countenance; and his eyes were ſo 
piercing that they ſeemed to penetrate, 
at a ſingle glance, into the hearts of men, 
and to read their moſt ſecret thoughts ; 
tew perſons could ſupport their ſcrutiny, 
or even endure to meet them twice. 
Yet, notwithſtanding all this gloom and 
auſterity, ſome rare occaſions of intereſt 
had called forth a character upon his 
countenance entirely different ; and he 
could adapt himſelf to the tempers and 
paſſions of perſons, whom he wiſhed to 
conciliate, with aſtoniſhing facility, and 
generally with complete triumph. This 

monk, 


1 


monk, this Schedoni, was the confeſſor 
and ſecret adviſer of the Marcheſa di 
Vivaldi. In the firſt efferveſcence of 
pride and indignation, which the diſ- 
covery of her ſon's intended marriage 
occaſioned, ſhe conſulted him on the 
means. of preventing it, and ſhe foon 
perceived that his talents promiſed to 
equal her wiſhes. Each poſſeſſed, in a 
conſiderable degree, the power of aſſiſt- 
ing the other; Schedoni had ſubtlety 
with ambition to urge it; and the Mar- 
cheſa had inexorable pride, and courtly 
influence; the one hoped to obtain a 
high benefice for his ſervices, and the 
other to ſecure the imaginary dignity of 
her houſe, by her gifts. Prompted by 
ſuch paſſions, and allured by ſuch views, 
they concerted in private, and unknown 
even to the Marcheſe, the means of ac- 
compliſhing their general end, 

Vivaldi, as he quitted his mother's 
cloſet, had met Schedoni in the corridor 


E 4 leading 


(. 204 


leading thither. He knew him to be her 
confeſſor, and was not much ſurpriſed to 
ſee him, though the hour was an unuſual 
one. Schedoni bowed: his head, as he 
paſſed, and aſſumed a. meek and holy 
countenance ; but Vivaldi, as he eyed 
him with a penetrating glance, now re- 
coiled with involuntary emotion; and it 
ſeemed as if a-ſhuddering pre-ſentiment 
of what this monk was preparing for 
him, had croſſed his mind.

&amp; Art thou any thing?

That makꝰ ſt my blood cold, and my hair to ſtand ? 
Speak to me, what thou art.“ 


Jorivs CSSAR. 


V IVALDI, from the period of his laſt 
viſit to Altieri, was admitted a frequent 
vifitor to Signora Bianchi, and Ellena 
was, at length, prevailed upon to join the 
party, when the converſation was always 
on indifferent topics. Bianchi, under- 
ſtanding the diſpolition of her niece's af- 
fections, and the accompliſhed mind and 
manners of. Vivaldi, judged that he was 


more likely to ſucceed by ſilent attentions 


than by a formal declaration of his ſen- 
timents. By ſuch a declaration, Ellena, 


till her heart was more engaged in his 


cauſe, would, perhaps, have been. alarm- 
ed into an abſolute rejection of his ad-

to happen, ſo long as he had an opportu- 
nity of converſing with her. 

Signora Bianchi had acknowledged to 
Vivaldi that he had no rival to appre- 
hend ; that Ellena had uniformly reje&amp;ed 
every admirer who had hitherto difcover- 
ed her within the ſhade of her retirement, 
and that her preſent reſerve proceeded 
more from conſiderations of the ſenti- 
ments of his family than from diſappro- 
bation of himſelf. He forbore, there- 
fore, to preſs his ſuit, till he ſhould have 
ſecured a ſtronger intereſt in her heart, 
and in this hope he was encouraged by 
Bianchi, whoſe gentle remonſtrances in 
his favour became every day more plea- 
ſing and more convincing. 

Several weeks paſſed away in this kind 
of intercourſe, till Ellena, yielding to the 
reprefentations of her aunt, and to the 
pleadings of her own heart, received Vi- 
valdi as an acknowledged admirer, and

the ſentiments of his family were -no 
longer remembered, or, if remembered, 
it was with a hope that they might at 
length be overcome by conſiderations 
more favourable to herſelf. 

The lovers, with Signora Bianchi and a 
Signor Giotto, a diſtant relation of the 
latter, frequently made excurſions in the 
delightful environs of Naples ; for Vi- 
valdi was no longer anxious to conceal 
his attachment, but wiſhed to contradict 
any report injurious to his love, by the 
publicity of his conduct; while the con- 
ſideration, that Ellena's name had ſuffer- 
ed by his late imprudente, contributed, 
with the unſuſpecting innocence and 
ſweetneſs of her manners towards him, 


who had been the occaſion of her in- 


juries, to mingle a ſacred pity with his 
love, which obliterated all family politics 
from his mind, and bound her irrecover- 
ably to his heart.

Theſe excurſions ſometimes led them to 
Puzzuoli, Baiæ, or the woody cliffs of 
Pauſilippo; and as, on their return, they 
glided along the moon: light bay, the 
melody of Italian ſtrains ſeemed to give 
enchantment to the ſcenery of its ſhore. 
At this cool hour the voices of the vine- 
dreſſers were frequently heard in trio, 
as they repoſed, after the labour of the 


day, on ſome pleaſant promontory, under 


the ſhade of poplars; or the briſk muſic 
of the dance from fiſhermen, on the mar- 
gin of the waves below. The boatmen 
reſted on their oars, while their company 
liſtened to voices modulated by ſenſibility 
to finer eloquence, than it is in the power 
of art alone to diſplay ; and at others, 
while they obſerved the airy natural 
grace, which diſtinguiſhes the dance of 
the fiſhermen and peaſants of Naples, 
Frequently as they glided round a pro- 
montory, whoſe ſhaggy maſſes impended 
far over the ſea, ſuch magic ſcenes of

beauty unfolded, adorned by theſe dancing 
groups on the bay beyond, as no pencil 
could do juſtice to. The deep clear wa- 
ters refle&amp;ed every image of the land- 
ſcape; the cliffs, branching into wild 
forms, crowned with groves, whoſe rough 
foliage often ſpread down their ſteeps in 
pictureſque luxuriance ; the ruined villa 
on ſome bold point, peeping through the 
trees; peaſants* cabins hanging on the 
precipices, and the dancing figures on the 
ſtrand—all touched with the ſilvery tint 
and foft ſhadows of moon-light. On 
the other hand, the fea, trembling with a 
long line of radiance, and ſhewing m the 
clear diſtance the fails of veſſels ſtealing in 
every direction along its ſurface, preſented 
a proſpect as grand as the landſcape was 
beautiful. 
One evening that Vivaldi fat with El. 
lena and Signora Bianchi, in the very pa- 
vilion where he had overheard that ſhort 
but intereſting ſoliloquy, which aſſured 
ah | him 


( 


him of her regard, he pleaded with more 
than his uſual earneſtneſs for a ſpeedy 
marriage. Bianchi did not oppoſe his 
arguments; ſhe had been unwell for 
ſome time, - and, believing herſelf. to be 
declining faſt, was anxious to have their 
nuptials concluded. She ſurveyed with 
languid eyes, the ſcene that ſpread before 
the pavilion. 'The ſtrong effulgence, which 
a-ſetting-ſun threw over the ſea, ſhewing 
innumerable gaily-painted ſhips, and fiſh- 
ing-boats returning from Santa Lucia 
into the port of Naples, had no longer 
power to cheer her. Even the Roman 
tower that terminated the mole below, 
touched as it was with the {lanting rays ; 
and the, various figures of fiſhermen, 
who lay ſmoking beneath its walls, in the 
long ſhadow, or who ſtood in ſunſhine 
on the beach, watching the approaching 
boats of their comrades, combined a 
picture, which was no longer intereſting, 
Alas!“ faid ſhe, breaking from medita- 

i tve 


„ 


tive ſilence, this ſun ſo glorious, which 
lights up all the various colouring of 
theſe ſhores, and the glow of thoſe ma- 
jeſtic mountains ; alas ! I feel that it will 
not long ſhine for me—my eyes muſt 
ſoon cloſe upon the proſpect for ever!“ 

To Ellena's tender reproach for this 
melancholy ſuggeſtion Bianchi replied 
only by expreſſing an earneſt wiſh to wit- 
neſs the certainty of her being protected; 
adding, that this muſt be foon, or ſhe 
mould not live to fee it. Ellena, ex- 
tremely ſhocked both by this preſage of 
her aunt's fate, and by the direct refer- 
ence made to her own condition in the 
preſence of Vivaldi, burſt mto tears, 
while he, ſupported by the wiſhes of 
Signora Bianchi, urged his ſuit with en- 
creaſed intereſt. 

6 This is not a time for faſtidious ſcru- 
ples,“ faid Bianchi,“ „no that a folemn 
truth calls out to us. My dear girl, I 
will not diſguiſe my feelings; they aſſure 
me 


55 
me I have not long to live. Grant me 
then the only requeſt I have to make, 

and my laſt hours will be comforted.” 
Atſter a paule ſhe added, as ſhe took the 
hand of her niece, This will, no doubt, 
be an awful ſeparation to us both; and 
it muſt alſo be a mournful one, Signor, 
turning to Vivaldi, “ for ſhe has been as 
a daughter to me, and I have, I truſt, ful- 
filled to her the duties of a mother. 
Judge then, what will- be her feelings 
when I am; no more. But it will be youe 
care to ſoothe them.“ | 
Vivaldi looked with emotion at Ellena, 
and would have ſpoken ; her aunt, how- 
ever, proceeded. *© My own feelings 
would now be little leſs poignant, if I 
did not believe that I was confiding her 
to a tenderneſs, which cannot diminiſh ; 
that I ſhould prevail with her to accept 
the protection of a huſband. To you, 
Signor, I commit the legacy of my child.

done, and, if poſſible, from misfortune !

are exhauſted,” 


While he liſtened to this ſacred charge, 
and recollected the injury Ellena had al- 
ready ſuſtained for his ſake, by the cruel 
obloquy which the Marcheſe had thrown: 
upon her character, he ſuffered a degree 
of | generous indignation, of which he: 
ſcarcely could conceal the cauſe, and a 
ſucceeding tenderneſs that almoſt melted 
him to tears; and he ſecretly vowed to 
defend her fame and protect her peace, 
at the ſacrifice of every other conſidera- 


tion. 


Bianchi, as ſhe concluded her exhorta- 
tion, gave Ellena's hand to Vivaldi, who 
received it with emotion ſuch as his coun- 
tenance, only, could expreſs, and with 


folemn fervour raiſing his eyes to heaven, 


vowed that he never would betray the 
9 thus repoſed in him, but would 
watch 


(- 1p 
watch over the happineſs of Ellena with 
a care as tender, as anxious, and as un- 
ceaſing as her own; that from this mo- 
ment he conſidered himſelf bound by ties 
not leſs ſacred than thoſe which the church 
confers, to defend her as his wife, and 
would do fo to the hteſt moment of his 
exiſtence. As he ſaid this, the truth of 
his feelings appeared in the energy of his 
manner. : 

Ellena, ſtill weeping, and agitated by 
various conſiderations, ſpoke not, but 
withdrawing the handkerchief from her 


face, ſhe looked at him through her tears, 
with a ſmile ſo meek, ſo affectionate, fo 


- timid, yet ſo confiding, as expreſſed all 


the mingled emotions. of her heart, and 
appealed more eloquently to his, than the 
moſt energetic language could have done. 

- Before Vivaldi left the villa, he had 


ſome further converſation with Signora 


Bianchi, when it was agreed that the 


nuptials ſhould be folemnized on the fol-

W lowing week, if Ellena could be prevailed

that when he returned the next day, her

the lightly-bounding ſteps of joy, which, 
however, when he arrived there, was

he, ſubduing the feelings which this de- 
grading mention of Ellena had arouſed, 
«© why will you perſiſt in oppoſing the

why will you continue to think unjuſtly

« As J am not a lover,” replied the 


Marcheſe, and that the age of boyiſh 


credulity is paſt with me, I do not wil- 
fully cloſe my mind againſt examination, 
but am direQed by proof and yield only

« What proof is it, my Lord, that has 
thus eafily convinced you?“ ſaid Vival- 
di; «© Who is it that perſiſts in abuſing 
your confidence, and in deſtroying my 
peace?“ 

The Marcheſe haughtily reproved his 
ſon for ſuch doubts and queſtions, and a 
long converſation enſued, which failed 
to alter the intereſts or the opinions 
of either party. The Marcheſe perſiſted 
in accufation and menace; and Vivaldi 
in defending Ellena, and in affirming, that 
his affections and intentions were irre- 
coverable.

parted mutually diflatisfied. The Mar.

accuſations had arouſed ſpirit and indigna- 
tion, when kindneſs and gentle remon- 
{trance would certainly have awakened 
filial affection, and might have occaſioned 
a conteſt in the breaſt of Vivaldi. Now, 
no ſtruggle of oppoſing duties divided 
his reſolution. He had no heſitation on 
the ſubje&amp; of diſpute; but, regarding 
his father as a haughty oppreſſor who 
would rob him of his moſt ſacred right; 
and as one who did not ſcruple to ſtain Wi 
the name of the innocent and the defence- We 
leſs, when his intereſt required it, upon 
the doubtful authority of a baſe informer, 
he ſuffered neither pity or remorſe to 
mingle with the reſolution of aſſerting 
the freedom of his nature ; and was even 
more anxious than before, to conclude a

marriage, which he believed would ſecure 
his own happineſs, and the reputation of 
Ellena. 

He returned, therefore, on the follow- 
ing morning to Villa Altieri, with encreaſed 
impatience to learn the reſult of Signora 
Bianchi's further converſation with her 

niece, and the day on which the nuptials 
might be folemnized. On the way 
thither, his thoughts were wholly occu- 
pied by Ellena, and he proceeded me- 
chanically, and without obſerving where 
he was, till the ſhade, which the well- 
known arch threw over the road, recalled 
him to local circumſtances, and a voice 
inſtantly arreſted his attention. It was 


the voice of the monk, whoſe figure again 


paſſed before him. Go not to Altieri,“ 
it faid ſolemnly, © for death is in the 


houſe !”? 


Before Vivaldi could recover from the 
diſmay, into which this abrupt aſſertion

the ſtranger was gone. He had eſcaped 
in the gloom of the place, and ſeemed to 
have retired into the obſcurity, from 
which he had ſo ſuddenly emerged, for 
he was not ſeen to depart from under 
the arch. Vivaldi purſued him with his 
voice, conjuring him to appear, and de- 
manding who was dead; but no voice 
replied. 
Believing that the ſtranger conid not 
have paſſed unſeen from the arch by 
any way, but that leading to the fortreſs 
above, Vivaldi began to aſcend the ſteps, 
when, confidermg that the more certain 
means of underftanding this awful aſſer- 
tion would be, to go immediately to 
Altieri, he left this portentous ruin, and 
haſtened thither. 
An indifferent perſon would perhaps 
have underſtood the words of the monk 
to allude to Signora Bianchi, whoſe in- g

the affrighted fancy of Vivaldi, the dying 
Ellena only appeared. His fears, how- 
ever probabilities might ſanction, or the 
event juſtify them, were natural to ardent 
affection; but they were accompanied by 
a preſentiment as extraordinary as it was 
horrible ; it occurred to him more than 
once, that Ellena was murdered. He 
ſaw her wounded, and bleeding to death; 
ſaw her afhy countenance, and her waſt- 
ing eyes, from which the ſpirit of life was 
I faſt departing, turned piteouſly on him- 
E ſelf, as if imploring him to ſave her from 
the fate that was dragging her to the 
grave. And, when he reached the bound- 
= ary of the garden, his whole frame tem- 
© bled ſo with horrible apprehenſion, that 
he reſted a while, unable to venture fur-

Naples, he approached the houſe. All 
around it was ſilent and forſaken; 
many of the lattices were cloſed, and, az 
he endeavoured to collect from every tri. 
vial circumſtance ſome conjecture, his 
Ipirits {till ſunk as he advanced, till, hav. 
ing arrived within a few paces of the 
portico, all his fears were confirmed. 
He heard from within a feeble ſound of 
lamentation, and then a few notes of that 
ſolemn and peculiar kind of recitative, 
which is in ſome parts of Italy the re- 
quiem of the dying. The ſounds were 
ſo low and diſtant that they only mur- 
mured on his ear ; but, without pauſing 
for information, he ruſhed into the porti- 
co, and knocked loudly at the folding 
doors, now cloſed againſt him. 

After repeated ſummonſes, Beatrice, 
the old houſe-keeper, appeared. She did 
not wait for Vivaldi's enquiries. ©* Alas!

difficulty, “ how and where?” 

« Alas! here in the villa, Signor,“ re- 
plied Beatrice, weeping ; © who would 
have thought that I ſhould live to fee this

* What has cauſed her death?“ inter-

«© I am better,” ſaid Vivaldi, raiſing 

himſelf; © lead me to her apartment,— 
I muſt ſee her. Do not heſitate, lead me 
on.“ 
« Alas! Signor, it is a diſmal fight; 
why ſhould you wiſh to ſee her ? Be per- 
tuaded ; do not go, Signor; it is a woe- 
Lul fight!” 

«&amp; Lead me on, repeated Vivaldi ſtern- 
ly ; © or if you refuſe, I will find the way 
myſelf.“ 

Beatrice, terrified by his look and gel- 
ture no longer oppoſed him, begging 
only that he would wait till ſhe had in- 
formed her lady of his' arrival ; but he 
followed her cloſely up the ſtaircaſe and 
-along a corridor that led round. the welt 
fide of the houſe, which brought him to 


a ſuite of chambers darkened by the 
cloſed

towards the one where the body lay. 
The requiem had ceaſed, and no found 
diſturbed the awful ſtillneſs that prevailed 
in theſe deſerted rooms. At the door of 
the laſt apartment, where he was com- 
pelled to ſtop, his agitation was ſuch, that 
Beatrice, expecting every inſtant to fee 
him ſink to the floor, made an effort to 
ſupport him with her feeble aid, but he 
gave a ſignal for her to retire, He ſoon 
' recovered himſelf and paſſed into the

might have affected him in any other 
ſtate of his ſpirits; but theſe were now 
too ſeverely preſſed upon by real ſuffer- 
ing to feel the influence of local circum- 
ſtances. Approaching the bed on which 
the corpſe was laid, he raiſed his eyes to 
the mourner who hung weeping over it, 
and beheld—Ellena! who, ſurpriſed by 
this ſudden intruſion, and by the agita-

or inclination to explain a circumſtance, 
which muſt deeply wound the heart of 
Ellena, ſince it would have told that the 
fame event, which excited her grief, had 
accidentally inſpired his joy. 

He did not long intrude upon the ſa- 
credneſs of ſorrow, and the ſhort time he 
remained was employed in endeavours to 
command his own emotion and to ſoothe 
her's. 

When he left Ellena, he had ſome con- 
verſation with Beatrice, as to the death of 
Signora Bianchi, and underſtood that ſhe 
had retired to reſt on the preceding night

not ſpeak, though ſhe tried often, but ſhe 
was ſenſible, for ſhe would look fo at 
Signora Ellena, and then try again to 
ſpeak ; it almoſt broke one's heart to ſee 
her. Something ſeemed to lie upon her

avail, She could not ſwallow what the 
Doctor offered her. She grew fainter 
and fainter, yet would often utter fach 
deep fighs, and then would graſp my

trive that I ſhould. ſee the face of your

Beatrice replied, that ſhe believed Sig- 
nora Ellena had none; and promiſed 
faithfully to obſerve his injunCtions.. 

He then left the villa, meditating on 
the circumſtances. he had juſt learned, 
and on the prophetic aflertion of the 
monk, between whom, and the cauſe of 
Bianchi's ſudden death, he could not 
forbear ſurmiſing there was ſome connec-

Schedoni, whomjhe had obſerved of late 


going more frequently than uſual, to his 


mother's apartment. He almoſt ſtarted, 
in horror of the ſuſpicion, to which this 
conjecture led, and precipitately rejected 
it, as a poiſon that would deſtroy his own 
peace for ever. But though he inſtantly 


diſmiſſed the ſuſpicion, the conjecture re- 


turned to his mind, and he endeavoured 
to recollect the voice and figure of the 
ſtranger, that he might compare them 
with thoſe of the confeſſor. The voices 
were, he thought, of a different tone, 
and the perſons of a different height and 
proportion. This compariſon, however, 
did not forbid him to ſurmiſe that the 
ſtranger was an agent of the confeſſor's; 
that he was, at leaſt, a ſecret ſpy upon his 
actions, and the defamer of Ellena ; 
while both, if indeed there were two per- 
ſons concerned, appeared to be at the 
command of his parents. Fired with in- 
dignation of the unworthy arts that he be- 
lieved to have been employed againſt him,

and impatient to meet the ſlanderer of Fl. 
lena, he determined to attempt ſome de- 
ciſive ſtep towards a diſcoveryof the truth, 
and either to compel the confeſſor to re- 
veal it to him, or to ſearch out his agent, 


who, he fancied, was occaſionally a reſi- 


dent within the ruins of Paluzzi. 

The inhabitants of the convent, which 
Beatrice had pointed out, did not eſcape 
his conſideration, but no reaſon appeared 
for ſuppoſing - them the enemies of his 
Ellena, who, on the contraty, he under- 
ſtood had been for ſome years amicably 
connected with them. The embroidered 
filks, of which the old ſervant had ſpoken, 
ſufficiently explained the nature of the 
connection, and diſcovering. more fully 
the circumftances of Ellena's fortune, her 
conduct heightened the tender admira- 
tion with which he had hitherto regarded 
ben. 

The hints for ſuſpicion i which Beatrice 
had given reſpecting the cauſe of her miſ- 
treſs's deceale, inceſſantly recurred to 

him;

him; and it appeared extraordinary, and 
ſometimes in the higheſt degree impro- 
bable, that any perſon could be fufh- 
ciently intereſted in the death of a woman 
apparently fo blameleſs, as to adminiſter 
poiſon to her. What motive could have 
prompted ſo horrible a deed, was ſtill 
more inexplicable. It was true that ſhe 
had long been in a declining ſtate ; yet 
the ſuddenneſs of her departure; and the 
ſingularity of ſome circumitances preced- 
ing as well as ſome appearances that had 
followed it, compelled Vivaldi to doubt 
as to the cauſe. He believed, however, 
that, after having ſeen the corpſe, his 
doubts muſt vaniſh; and Beatrice had 
promiſed, that, if he could return in the 
evening, when Ellena had retired to reſt, 
he ſhould be permitted to viſit the cham- 
ber of the deceaſed. There was ſome- 
thing repugnant to his. feelings in going 
thus ſecretly, or, indeed, at all, to the re- 


&amp; - ſidence of Ellena at this delicate period, 


yet

yet it was neceſſary he ſhould introduce 
there ſome medical profeſſor, on whole 
judgment he could reſt reſpeCting the oc- 
caſion of Bianchi's death; and as he be- 
heved he ſhould ſo ſoon acquire the right 


of vindicating the honour of Ellena, that 
conſideration did not ſo feriouſly affect 
him as otherwiſe it would have done. 
The enquiry which called him thither 
was, befides, of a nature too ſolemn and 
important to be lightly reſigned ; he had, 
therefore, told Beatrice he would be 
punctual to the hour ſhe appointed. His 
intention to ſearch for the monk was thus: 
again interrupted.

W uv Vivaldi returned to Naples, he 
enquired for the Marcheſa, of whom he 
wiſhed to aſk ſome queſtions concerning 
Schedoni, which, though he ſcarcely ex- 
pected they would be explicitly anſwered, 
might yet lead to part of the truth he 
ſought for. | | | 
The Marcheſa was in her cloſet, and 
Vivaldi found the confeſſor with her. 
* 'This man croſſes me, like my evil ge- 
nius,“ ſaid he to himſelf as he entered, 
* but I will know whether he deſerves 
my ſuſpicions before I leave the room. 
Schedoni was ſo deeply engaged in 
converſation, that he did not immediately 
perceive: 


; ©. =, 
perceive Vivaldi, who ſtood for a moment 
examining his countenance, and tracing 
ſubjects for curioſity in its deep lines. 
His eyes, while he ſpoke, were caſt down- 
ward, and his features were fixed in an 
expreſſion at once ſevere and crafty. The 
Marcheſa was liſtening with deep atten-

if to catch the loweſt murmur of his 
voice, and her face picturing the anxiety 
and vexation of her mind. This was evi- 
dently a conference, not a confeſſion. 
Vivaldi advaneing, the monk raifed his 
eyes; his countenance ſuffered no change, 
as they met thoſe of Vivaldi. He roſe, 
but did not take leave, and returned the 
flight and ſomewhat haughry falutation of 
Vivaldi, with an inclination of the head, 
that indicated a pride without pettiſhneſs, 
and a firmnefs bordering on contempt. 
The Marcheſa, on perceiving her ſon, 
was ſomewhat embarraſſed, and her brow, 


before ſlightly contracted by vexation,

now frowned with reſentment. Vet it 
was an involuntary emotion, for ſhe en- 
deavoured to chace the expreſſion of it 
with a ſmile. Vivaldi liked the ſmile 
ſtill leſs: than the frown. 

Schedoni ſeated himſelf . and 
began, with almoſt the eaſe of a man of 
the world, to converſe on general topics. 
Vivaldi, however, was reſerved and ſilent; 
he knew not how to begin a converſa- 
tion, which might lead to the knowledge 
he deſired, and the Marcheſa did not re- 
lieve him from the difficulty. His eye 
and his ear aſſiſted him to conjecture at 
leaſt, if not to obtain, the information he 
withed ; and, as he liſtened to the deep 
tones of Schedoni's voice, he became al- 
moſt certain, that they were not the ac- 
cents of his unknown adviſer, though he 
confidered, at the ſame moment, that it 
was not difficult to diſguiſe, or to feign a 
voice. His ſtature ſeemed to decide the 


queſtion more reaſonably ; for the figure 
of 


a 


of Schedoni appeared taller than that of 
the ſtranger; and though there was 
ſomething of reſemblance in their air, 
which Vivaldi had never obſerved before, 
he again conſidered, that the habit of the 
Tame order, which each wore, might 
eaſily occaſion an artificial reſemblance. 
Of the likeneſs, as to countenance, he 
could not judge, fince the ſtranger's had 
been ſo much ſhrouded by his cowl, that 
Vivaldi had never diſtinctly ſeen a ſingle 
feature. Schedoni's hood was now 
thrown back, ſo that he could not com- 
pare even the air of their heads under 
fimilar circumſtances ; but as he remem- 
bered to have ſeen the confeſſor on a for- 
mer day approaching his mother's cloſet 
with the cowl ſhading his face, the fame 


gloomy ſeverity ſeemed to characterize 


both, and nearly the ſame terrible por- 
trait was drawn on, his fancy. Yet this 
again might be only an artificial effect, a 
character which the cowl alone gave to

the head; and any face ſeen imperfectly 
beneath its dark ſhade, might have ap- 
peared equally ſevere. Vivaldi was ſtil 
extremely perplexed in his opinion, One 
circumſtance, however, ſeemed to throw 
ſome light on his judgment. The ſtranger 
had appeared in the habit of a monk, 
and, if Vivaldi's tranſient obſervation 
might be truſted, he was of the very ſame 
order with that of Schedoni. Now if he 
were Schedoni, or even his agent, it was 
not probable that he would have ſhewn 
himſelf in a dreſs that might lead to a diſ- 
covery of his perſon. That he was 
anxious for concealment, his manner had 
ſtrongly proved; it ſeemed then, that this 
habit of a monk was only a diſguiſe, aſ- 
ſumed for the purpoſe of miſleading con- 
jecture. Vivaldi, however, determined 
to put ſome queſtions to Schedoni, and at 


the ſame time to obſerve their effect on 


his countenance. He took occaſion to 
notice ſome drawings of ruins, which or- 
namented 


„ 


namented the cabinet of the Marcheſa, 
and to ſay that the fortreſs of Paluzzi was 
worthy of being added to her collection. 
&amp; You have ſeen it lately, perhaps, Te- 
verend father, added Vivaldi, with a pe- 
netrating glance. 

&lt;« It is a ſtriking relique of antiquity,” 
replied the confeſſor. 

«© That arch,” reſumed Vivaldi, his eye 
ſtill fixed on Schedoni, © that arch ſuſ- 
pended between two rocks, the one over- 
topped by the towers of the fortreſs, the 
other ſhadowed with pine and broad oak, 
has a fine effect. But a picture of it 
would want human figures. Now either 
the groteſque ſhapes of banditti lurking 
within the ruin, as if ready to ſtart out 
upon the traveller, or a friar rolled up 
in his black garments, juſt ſtealing forth 
from under the ſhade of the arch, and 
looking like ſome ſupernatural meſſen- 
ger of evil, would finiſh the piece.”

The features of Schedoni ſuffered no 
change during theſe remarks. © Your 
picture is complete,“ ſaid he, © and I can- 
not but admire the facility with which you 
have claſſed the monks together with ban- 
ditti.“ | 

« Your pardon, holy father,“ ſaid Vi- 
valdi, © I did not draw a parallel between 
them.“ 

« O! no offence, Signor,“ replied 
Schedoni, with a ſmile ſomewhat ghaſtly. 

During the latter part of this converſa- 
tion, if converſation it may be called, the 
Marcheſa had followed a ſervant, who 
had brought her a letter, out of the apart- 


ment, and as the confeſſor appeared to 


await her return, Vivaldi determined to 
preſs his enquiry. It appears, how- 
ever,” ſaid he, that Paluzzi, if not 
haunted by robbers, is at leaſt frequented 
by ecclefiaſtics ; for I have ſeldom paſſed 
it without ſeeing one of the order, and 
that one has, appeared fo ſuddenly, and

vaniſhed ſo ſuddenly, that I have been al- 
molt compelled to believe he was literally 

a ſpiritual being!“ 

«© The convent of the Black Penitents 
is not far diſtant,” obſerved the confeſſor. 

* Does the dreſs of this convent re- 
ſemble that of your order, reverend fa- 
ther? for I obſerved that the monk 1 
ſpeak of was habited like yourſelf; aye, 
and he was about your ſtature, and very 
much reſembled you.” 

“That well may be, Signor,“ replied 
the confeſſor calmly ; © there are many 
brethren who, no doubt, reſemble each 
other ; but the brothers of the Black Pe- 
nitents are clothed in ſackcloth ; and the 
death's head on the garment, the peculiar 
ſymbol of this order, would not have 
eſcaped your obſervation ; it could not, 
therefore, be a member of their chant 
whom you have ſeen.” 

«© am not inclined to think that it 
was,” ſaid Vivaldi; © but be it who it

may, I hope ſoon to be better acquainted 
with him, and to tell him truths ſo ſtrong, 
that he ſhall not be permitted even to af- 
fect the miſunderſtanding of them.“ 

« You will do right, if you have cauſe 


of complaint againſt him,” obſerved Sche- 


doni. 


« And only if I have cauſe of complaint, 
holy father? Are ſtrong truths to be told 
only when there is direct cauſe of com- 
plaint? Is it only when we are injured 
that we are to be ſincere?” He believed 


that he had now detected Schedoni, who 


ſeemed to have betrayed a conſciouſneſs 
that Vivaldi had reaſon for complaint 
againſt the ſtranger. 

* You will obſerve, reverend father, 
that I have not ſaid I am injured,” he 


added. If you know that I am, this 
E muſt be by other means than by my 


words; I have not even expreſſed reſent- 
ment.“ 


Except by your voice and eye, Sig- 


nor,“ replied Schedoni drily. “ When a 


2 man 


(248 


man 1s vehement and diſordered, we uſu- 
ally are inclined to ſuppoſe he feels reſent- 
ment, and that he has cauſe of complaint, 
elther real or imaginary. As I have not 
the honour of being acquainted with the 
ſubject you allude to, I cannot decide to 
which of the two your cauſe belongs,” 

J have never been in doubt as to 
that,” ſaid Vivaldi haughtily; “and if I 
had, you will pardon me, holy father, 
but I ſhould not have requeſted your de- 
ciſion. My injuries are, alas! too real; 
and I now think it is alſo too certain to 
whom I may attribute them. The ſecret 
adviſer, who ſteals into the boſom of a 
family only to poiſon its repoſe, the in- 
former -- the baſe aſperſer of innocence, 
ſtand revealed in one perſon.” 

Vivaldi delivered theſe words with a 
tempered energy, at once dignified and 
pointed, which ſeemed to ſtrike directly 
to the heart of Schedoni; but, whether 
it was his conſcience or his pride that took 


the alarm, did not certainly appear. Vi- 
valdi

valdi believed the former. A dark ma- 
lignity overſpread the features of the 
monk, and at that moment Vivaldi 
thought he beheld a man, whoſe paſſions 
might impel him to the perpetration of 
almoſt any crime, how hideous ſoever. 
He recoiled from him, as if he had ſud- 
denly ſeen a ſerpent in his path, and ſtood 
gazing on his face, with an attention fo 
wholly occupied as to be unconſcious that 
he did ſo. 

Schedoni almoſt inſtantly recovered him- 
ſelf; his features relaxed from their firſt 
expreſſion, and that portentous darkneſs 
paſſed away from his countenance; but 
with a look that was ſtill ſtern and haugh- 
ty, he ſaid, Signor, however ignorant I 
may be of the ſubject of your diſcontent, 
cannot miſunderſtand that your reſent- 
ment is, to ſome extent or other, directed 
againſt myſelf as the cauſe of it. Vet [

the ignominious titles you have juſt ut-

&lt;« have applied them to the author of

father, can beſt inform me whether they

fud Schedoni, adroitly, and with a ſud- 
den calmneſs that ſurpriſed Vivaldi. It 
you directed them againſt the author of

The chearful complacency, with which 
he ſpoke this, renewed the doubts of Vi- 
yaldi, who thought it nearly impoſſible 
that a man conſcious of guilt could al- 
ſume, under the very charge of it, the 
tranquil and dignified air, which the con- 
feſſor now diſplayed. He began to accuſe 
himſelf of having condemned him with 
paſſionate raſhneſs, and gradually became 
ſhocked at the indecorum of his conduct

| him, he was now inclined to think the c- 
ſect of a jealous and haughty honour, and 
be almoſt forgot the malignity, which 


had mingled with Schedoni's pride, in 
ſorrow for the offence that had provoked

it. Thus, not leſs precipitate in his pity 
i ; than his anger, and credulous alike to 
4 ; the paſſion of the moment, he was now as 
= | eager to apologize for his error, as he had 

been haſty in committing it. The frank- 
h neſs, with which he apologized and la- 
i- W mented the impropriety of his conduct, 
le would have won an eaſy forgiveneſs from 
al- We a generous heart. Schedoni liſtened with 
he | apparent complacency and ſecret con- 
on- tempt. He regarded Vivaldi as a raſh 
uſe boy, who was ſwayed only by Bis paſ- 
th WW fions ; but while he ſuffered deep reſent- 


me ment for the evil in his character, he felt 
q 64 neither 


( 152 ) 
neither reſpect nor kindneſs for the good, 
for the ſincerity, the love of juſtice, the 
generoſity, which threy a brilliancy even 
on his foibles. Schedoni, indeed, ſaw 
only evil in human nature. 

Had the heart of Vivaldi been leſs ge- 
nerous, he would now have diſtruſted the 
ſatisfaction, which the confeſſor aflumed, 
and have diſcovered the contempt and 
malignity, that lurked behind the ſmile 
thus imperfectly maſking his countenance, 
The confeſſor perceived his power, and 
the character of Vivaldi lay before him as 
a map. He ſaw, or fancied he ſaw, every 
line and feature of its plan, and the rela- 
tive proportions of every energy and 
weakneſs of its nature. He believed, 
alſo, he could turn the very virtues of 
this young man againft himſelf, and he 
exulted, even while the ſmile of good- 
will was yet upon his countenance, in an- 


ticipating the moment that ſhould avenge 
him 


08-3 
him for the paſt outrage, and which, 


while Vivaldi was ingenuouſly lamenting 


it, he had apparently forgotten. 
Schedoni was thus ruminating evil 


againſt Vivaldi, and Vivaldi was conſi- 


dering how he might poſſibly make Sche- 
doni atonement for the affront he had of- 
fered him, when the Marcheſa returned 
to the apartment, and perceived in the 
honeſt countenance of Vivaldi ſome ſymp- 
toms of the agitation which had paſſed 
over it ; his complexion was fluſhed, and 
his brow ſlightly contracted. The aſpect 
of Schedoni told nothing but compla- 
cency, except that now and then when 
he looked at Vivaldi, it was with half. 
ſhut eyes, that indicated treachery, or, at 
leaſt, cunning, trying to conceal exaſpe- 
rated pride. 

The Marcheſa, with diſpleaſure directed 
againſt her ſon, enquired the reaſon of his 
emotion; but he, ſtung with conſciouſ- 
neſs of his conduct towards the monk,

could neither endure to explain it, or to 
remain in her preſence, and faying that 
he would confide his honour to the di- 
cretion of the holy father, who would 
ſpeak only too favourably of his fault, he 
abruptly left the room. 

When he had departed, Schedoni gave, 
with ſeeming reluctance, the explanation 
which the Marcheſa required, but was 
_ cautious not to ſpeak too favourably of 
Vivaldi's conduct, which, on the con- 
trary, he repreſented as much more in- 
ſulting than it really was; and, while he 
aggravated the offenſive part of it, he ſup- 
preſſed all mention of the candour and 
ſelf-reproach which had followed the 
charge. Vet this he managed ſo artfully 
that he appeared to extenuate Vivaldi's 
errors, to lament the haſtineſs of his 
temper, and to plead for a forgiveneſ 
from his irritated mother. © He is very 
young, added the monk, when he per- 
_ ceived that he had ſufficiently exaſperated 
the 


5 


the Marcheſa againſt her ſon; © he is 
very young, and youth is warm in its 
paſſions and precipitate in its judgments, 
He was, beſides, jealous, no doubt, of 
the friendſhip, with which you are pleaſ- 
ed to honour me; and it is natural that 


= aſon ſhould be jealous of the attention of 


ſuch a mother.“ 


* You are too good, father,“ ſaid the 
Marcheſa; her reſentment encreaſing to- 
wards Vivaldi in proportion as Schedoni 
diſplayed his artificial candour and meek- 
neſs. 

It is true,” continued the confeſſor, 
that I perceive all the inconveniences to 
which my attachment, I ſhould fay my 
duty to your family expoſes me; but I 
willingly ſubmit to theſe, while it is yet 
poſſible that my advice may be a means 
of preſerving the honour of your houſe 
unſullied, and of faving this inconſider- 
ate young man from future miſery and 
unavailing repentance.”

During the warmth of this ſympathy 
in reſentment, the Marcheſa and Sche- 
doni mutually, and ſincerely, loſt their 
remembrance of the unworthy motives, 
by which each knew the other to be in- 
fluenced, as well as that diſguſt which 
thoſe who act together to the ſame bad 
end, can ſeldom eſcape from feeling to- 
wards their aſſociates. The Marcheſa, 
while ſne commended the fidelity of Sche- 
doni, forgot his views and her promiſes 
as to a rich benefice ; while the confeſſor 
imputed her anxiety for the ſplendor of 
her ſon's condition to a real intereſt in 
his welfare, not a care of her own digni- 
ty. After mutual compliments had been 
exchanged, they proceeded to a long 
conſultation concerning Vivaldi, and it 
was agreed, that their efforts for what 
they termed his preſervation ſhould no 
longer be confined to remonſtrances.

SHAKESPEARE. 


Vvaro:, when his firſt feelings of 
pity and compunction for having inſult- 
ed an aged man, the member of a ſacred 
profeſſion, were paſt, and when he look- 
ed with a more deliberate eye upon ſome 
circumſtances of the confeſſor's conduct, 
perceived that ſuſpicion was again gather- 
ing on his mind. But, regarding this as 
a ſymptom of his own weakneſs, rather 
than as a hint of truth, he endeavoured, 
with a magnanimous diſdain, to reject 
every ſurmiſe that boded unfavourably of 
Schedoni. 


When evening arrived, he haſtened 


towards Villa Altieri, and, having met 


without the city, according to appoint-

ment, a phyſician, upon whoſe honor 
and judgment he thought he might rely, 
they proceeded on their way together. 
Vivaldi had forgotten, during the confu- 
ſion of his laſt interview with Ellena, to 
deliver up the key of the garden-gate, 
and he now entered it as uſual, though 
he could not entirely overcome the re- 
luctance, which he felt on thus viſiting, 
in ſecret and at night, the dwelling of 
Ellena. Under no other circumſtances, 
however, could the phyſician, whoſe opi- 
nion was ſo neceflary to his peace, be in- 
troduced without betraying a ſuſpicion, 
which muſt render her unhappy, perhaps 
for ever. 

Beatrice, who had watched for them 
in the portico, led the way to the cham- 
ber where the corpſe was laid out; and 
Vivaldi, though conſiderably affected 
when he entered, ſoon recovered com- 
poſure enough to take his ſtation on one 
de of the bed, while the phyſician 

placed 


( 159 ) 

placed himſelf on the other. Unwilling 
to expoſe his emotion to the obſervation 
of a ſervant, and deſirous alſo of ſome 
private converſation with the phyſician, 
he took the lamp from Beatrice and diſ- 
miſled her. As the light glared upon the 
livid- face of the corpſe, Vivaldi gazed 
with melancholy ſurpriſe, and an effort 
of reaſon was neceſſary to convince him, 
that this was the ſame countenance which 
only one evening preceding was animated 
like his own; which had looked upon 
him in tears, while, with anxiety the moſt 
tender, Bianchi had committed the hap- 
pineſs of her niece to his care, and had, 
alas! too juſtly predicted her approach- 
ing diſſolution. The circumſtances of 
that ſcene now appeared to him like a 
viſion, and touched every fibre of his 
heart. He was fully ſenſible of the im- 
portance of the truſt committed to him, 
and, as he now hung over the pale and 
deſerted form of Bianchi, he filently re- 

newed

newed his ſolemn vows to Ellena, to de- 
ſerve the confidence of her departed 
guardian. 

Before Vivaldi had courage enough to 
aſk the opinion of the phyſician, who was 
ſtill viewing the face of the deceaſed with 
very earneſt attention and a diſapprov- 
ing countenance, his own ſuſpicions 
ſtrengthened from ſome circumſtances 
of her appearance; and particularly 
from the black tint that prevailed over 
her complexion, it ſeemed to him, that 
her death had been by poiſon. He feared 
to break a ſilence, which prolonged his 
hope of the contrary, feeble though it 
was ; and the phyſician, who probably 
was apprehenſive for the conſequence of 
delivering his real thought, did not ſpeak. 

5 I read your opinion,” ſaid Vivaldi, 
at length, © it coincides with my own.“ 

© I know not as to that, Signor,“ re- 
plied the phyſician, though I think I 
perceive what is yours. Appearances 

| are

are unfavourable, yet I will not take 
upon me to decide from them, that it is 
as you ſuſpect. There are other circum- 
ſtances, under which ſimilar appearances 
might occur.“ He gave his reaſons for 
this aſſertion, which were plauſible even 
to Vivaldi, and concluded with requeſt- 
ing to ſpeak with Beatrice, for I wiſh 
to underſtand,” ſaid he, „what was the 
exact ſituation of this lady for ſome hours 
previous to her deceaſe.“ 

After a converſation of ſome length 
with Beatrice, whatever might be the 
opinion reſulting from his enquines, he 
adhered nearly to his former aſſertions; 
pronouncing that ſo many contradictory 
circumſtances appeared, as rendered it 
impoſhble for him to decide, whether 
Bianchi had died by poiſon, or other- 
wiſe. He ſtated more fully than he had 


done before, the reaſons which muſt ren- 
der the opinion of any medical perſon, 
on this ſubject, doubtful. But, whether

it was that he feared to be reſponſible 
for a deciſion, which would accuſe ſome 
perſon of murder, or that he really was 
mclined to believe that Bianchi died na- 
turally, it is certain he ſeemed diſpoſed 
to adopt the latter opinion; and that he 
was very anxious to quiet the ſuſpicions 
of Vivaldi. He ſo far ſucceeded, indeed, 
as to convince him that it would be un- 
availing to purſue the enquiry, and, at 
length, almoſt compelled him to believe, 
that ſhe had departed according to the 
common courſe of nature. 

Vivaldi, having lingered awhile over 
the death-bed of Bianchi, and taken a 
laſt farewell of her ſilent form, quitted 
the chamber and the houſe as ſoftly as 
he had approached, and unobſerved, as 
he believed, by Ellena or any other per- 
ſon. The morning dawned over the ſea, 
when he returned into the garden, and a 
few fiſhermen, loitering on the beach, or 
putting off their little boats from the 

ſhore.

ſhore, were the only perſons viſible at 
this early hour. The time, however, 
was paſſed for renewing the enquiry he 
had purpoſed at Paluzzi, and the bright- 
ening dawn warned him to retire. To 
Naples, therefore, he returned, with ſpi- 
rits ſomewhat ſoothed by a hope, that Bi- 
anchi had not fallen prematurely, and by 
the certainty that Ellena was well. On 
the way thither, he paſſed the fort with- 
out interruption, and, having parted with 
the phyſician, was admitted into his fa- 
ther's manſion by a confidential ſervant.

Even from darkneſs, 


SHAKESPEARE, 


Erirxa, on thus ſuddenly loſing her 
aunt, her only relative, the friend of her 
whole lite, felt as if left alone in the 
world, But it was not in the firſt mo- 


ments of affliction that this feeling occur- 


red. Her own forlorn ſituation was not 
even obſerved, while affection, pity, and 
irreſiſtible grief for Bianchi, occupied her 
heart. | 

Bianchi was to be interred in the 
church belonging to the convent of 
Santa Maria della Pieta. The body, at- 
tired according to the cuſtom of the 
country, and decorated with flowers, 


was carried on an open bier to the place 
of 


6 


of interment, attended only by prieſts 
and torch- bearers. But Ellena could not 
endure thus lightly to part with the re- 
liques of a beloved friend, and being re- 
ſtrained by cuſtom from following the 
corpſe to the grave, ſhe repaired firſt to 
the convent, to attend the funeral ſer- 
vice. Her ſorrow did not allow her to 
join in the choral ſymphonies of the nuns, 
but their ſacred ſolemnity was ſoothing to 
her ſpirits, and the tears ſhe ſhed while 
ſhe liſtened to the lengthening notes, 
aſſuaged the force of grief, 

When the ſervice concluded, ſhe with- 
drew to the parlour of the lady Abbeſs, 
who mingled with her conſolations many 


entreaties that Ellena would make the 


convent her preſent aſylum; and her af- 
fliction required little perſuaſion on this 
ſubject. It was her wiſh to retire hither, 
as to a ſanctuary, which was not only 
ſuitable to her particular circumſtances, 
but eſpecially adapted to the preſent ſtate

of her ſpirits. Here ſhe believed that ſhe 
ſhould ſooner acquire reſignation, and re- 
gain tranquillity, than in a place lefs con- 
ſecrated to religion ; and, before ſhe took 
leave of the Abbeſs, it was agreed, that 
ſhe ſhould be received as a boarder. 
To acquaint Vivaldi with her intention 
was, indeed, her chief motive for return- 
ing to Villa Altieri, after this her reſolu- 
tion had been taken. Her affection and 
eſteem had been gradual in their pro- 
greſs, and had now attained a degree ot 
ſtrength, which promiſed to decide the 
happineſs or miſery of her whole lie. 
The ſanction given by her aunt to this 
choice, and particularly the very folemn 
manner in which, on the evening preced- 
ing her death, ſhe bequeathed Ellena to 
Vivaldr's care, had ſtill endeared him to 
her heart, and imparted a ſacredneſs to 
the engagement, which made her conſi- 
der him as her guardian and only ſurviv- 
ing protector. 'The more tenderly ſhe

lamented her deceaſed relative, the more 
tenderly ſhe thought of Vivaldi ; and her 
love for the one was ſo intimately con- 
nected with her affection for the other, 
that each ſeemed ſtrengthened and exalt- 
ed by the union. 
When the funeral was over, they met 
at Altieri. | | 
} He was neither ſurpriſed or averſe to 
E her withdrawing awhile to a convent z 
for there was a propriety in retiring, dur» 
ing the period of her grief, from a home 
where ſhe had no longer a guardian, 
which delicacy ſeemed to demand. He 
only ſtipulated, that he might be permit- 
ted to viſit her in the parlour of the con- 
vent, and to claim, when decorum ſhould 
no longer object to it, the hand, which 
Bianchi had reſigned to him. 
Notwithitanding that he yielded to this 
arrangement without complaining, it was 
not entirely without repining ; but being

Abbeſs of La Pieta, he endeavoured to 
ſilence the ſecret murmurs of his heart 

with the conviction of his judgment. 
Meanwhile, the deep impreſſion made 
by his unknown tormentor, the monk, 
and eſpecially by the prediction of the 
death of Bianchi, remained upon his 
mind, and he once more determuned to 
aſcertain, if poſſible, the true nature of 
this portentous viſitant, and what were 
the motives which induced him thus to 
haunt his footſteps and interrupt his 
peace. He was awed by the circum- 
ſtances which had attended the viſitations 
of the monk, if monk it was; by the 
ſuddenneſs of his appearance, and depart- 
ure; by the truth of his prophecies; 
and, above all, by the ſolemn event 
which had verified his laſt warning; 
and his imagination, thus elevated by 
wonder and painful curioſity, was pre- 
pared for ſomething above the reach of 
common conjecture, and beyond the ac- 
compliſhment 


(10991 


compliſhment of human agency. His 
underſtanding was ſufficiently clear and 
ſtrong to teach him to detect many errors 
of opinion that prevailed around him, .as 
well as to deſpiſe the common ſuperſti- 
tions of his country, and, in the uſual 
ſtate of his mind, he probably would 
not have heſitated for a moment on the 
ſubject before him; but his paſſions were 
now intereſted and his fancy awakened, 
and, though he was unconſcious of this 
propenſity, he would, perhaps, have been 
ſomewhat diſappointed to have deſcended 
ſuddenly from the region of fearful ſub- 
limity, to which he had ſoared--the world 
of terrible ſhadows !—to the earth, on 
which he daily walked, and to an ex- 
planation ſimply natural. 

He deſigned to viſit again, at midnight, 
the fortreſs of Paluzzi, and not to watch 
tor the appearance of the ſtranger, but to 
carry torches into every receſs of the 
ruin, and diſcover, at leaſt, whether it

was Faunted by any other human being 
than himſelf. The chief difficulty, which 
had hitherto delayed him, was that of find. 
ing a perſon, in whom he could confide, 
to accompany him in the ſearch, ſince his 
tormer adventure had warned him never 
to renew it alone. Signor Bonarmo per- 
ſiſted abſolutely, and, perhaps, wiſely, to 
refuſe his requeſt on this ſubject ; and, 
as Vivaldi had no other acquaintance, to 
whom he choſe to give ſo much explana- 
tion of the affair as might induce com- 
pliance, he at length determined to take 
with him Paulo, his own ſervant. 

On the evening, previous to the day 
of Ellena's departure to La Pieta, Vivaldi 
went to Altieri, to bid her adieu. Dur- 
ing this interview his ſpirits were more 
than uſually depreſſed; and, though he 
knew that her retirement was only for a 
ſhort period, and had as much conh- 
dence in the continuance of her affec- 
tion, as is, perhaps, poſſible to à lover,

Vivaldi felt as if he was parting with her 
for ever. A thouſand vague and fearful 
conjectures, ſuch as he had never till 
this moment admitted, aſſailed him, and 
amongſt them, it appeared probable, 
that the arts of the nuns might win her 
from the world, and ſacrifice her to the 
cloiſter. In her prelent ſtate of ſorrow 
this ſeemed to be even more than pro- 
bable, and not all the aſſurances which 
Ellena gave him, and in theſe parting 
moments ſhe ſpoke with leſs reſerve 
than ſhe had hitherto done, could re- 
animate his mind. It ſhould ſeem, Elle- 
na, by theſe boding fears,“ ſaid he, im- 
prudently, © that I am parting with you 
for ever; I feel a weight upon my heart, 
which I cannot throw off, Yet I con- 
ſent that you ſhall withdraw awhile to

neſs. , I ought to feel aſſured of all this; 
yet ſo apt are my fears that I cannot con- 
fide in what is probable, but rather ap- 
prehend what is poſſible. And is it then 
poſſible that I yet may loſe you; and 1; 
it only probable that you may be mine 
for ever? How, under ſuch circum- 
ſtances, could I weakly conſent to your 
retirement? Why did I not urge you to 
beſtow immediately thoſe indifloluble 
bands, which no human force can burſt 
aſunder? How could I leave the deſtiny 
of all my peace within the reach of a poſ- 
ſibility, which it was once in my power 
to have removed! Which it was in my 
power I—It is, perhaps, {till in my power. 
O Ellena ! let the ſeverities of cuſtom 
yield to the lecurity of my happineſs. If 
you do go to La Pieta, let it be only to 


viſit its altar!“ 
5 5 Vivaldi 


C13} 


Vivaldi delivered this expoſtulation 
with a rapidity, that left no pauſe for 
Ellena to interrupt him. When, -at 
length, he concluded, ſhe gently re- 
proached him for doubting the conti- 
nuance of her regard, and endeavoured 
to ſoothe his apprehenſion of misfortune, 
but would not liſten to his requeſt. 
She repreſented, that not only the ſtate 
of her - ſpirits required retirement, but 
that reſpe&amp; to the memory of her aunt 
demanded it; and added gravely, that 
if he had ſo little confidence in the ſtea- 
dineſs. of her opinions, as to doubt the 
conſtancy of her affection, and for ſo 
mort a period, unleſs her vows were ſe- 
cured to him, he had done imprudently 
to elect her for the companion of his 
whole life. |

he had betrayed, beſought her forgive-

henfions which paſſion only made plau- 
ible, and which reaſon reproved ; not- 
withſtanding which, he could recover 
neither tranquillity nor confidence; nor 
could Ellena, though her conduct was 
ſupported and encouraged by juſtneſs of 
ſentiment, entirely remove the opprel- 
ſion of ſpirits ſhe had felt from almoſt 
the firſt moment of this interview. They 
parted with many tears; and Vivaldi, 
before he finally took his leave, fre- 
quently returned to claim ſome promiſe, 
or to aſcertain ſome explanation, till El- 
lena remarked with a forced ſmile, that 
theſe reſembled eternal adieus, rather 
than thoſe of only a few days; an ob- 
ſervation which renewed all his alarm, 
and furniſhed an excuſe for again delay- 
ing his departure. At length he tore 
himſelf away, and left Villa Altieri; but 
as the time was yet too early to ſuit his 
purpoſed enquiry at Paluzzi, he returned 


to Naples.

C 175. ) 


Ellena, meanwhile, endeavouring to 
diſſipate melancholy recollections by em- 
ployment, continued buſied in prepara- 
tion for her departure on the following 
day, till a late hour of the night. In the 
proſpect of quitting, though only for ſo 
ſhort a period, the home where ſhe had 
paſſed almc t every day fince the dawn of 
her earlieſt remembrance, there was 
ſomething melancholy, if not ſolemn. 
In leaving theſe well-known ſcenes, 
where, it might be ſaid, the ſhade of 
her deceaſed relative ſeemed yet to linger, 
ſhe was quitting all veſtige of her late 
happineſs, all note of former years and 
of preſent conſolation ; and ſhe felt as if 
going forth into a new and homeleis 
world. Her affection for the place in- 
creaſed as the paſſing time diminiſhed, 
and it ſeemed as if the laſt moment of 
her ſtay would be preciſely that in which 
the Villa Altieri would be moſt valued.

In her favourite apartments ſhe linger. 
ed for a conſiderable time; and in the 
room where ſhe had {upped on the night 
immediately preceding the death of Sig- 
nora Bianchi, ſhe indulged many tender 
and mournful recollections, and proba- 
bly would have continued to indulge 
them much longer, had not her atten- 
tion been withdrawn by a ſudden ruſt- 
ling of the foliage that ſurrounded the 
window, when, on raifing her eyes, the - 
thought ſhe perceived ſome perſon pals 
quickly from before it. The lattices had, 
as uſual, been left open to admit the freſh 
breeze from the bay below, but ſhe now 
roſe with ſome alarm to cloſe them, ard 
had ſcarcely done ſo when ſhe heard a 
diſtant knocking from the portico, and 
in the next inſtant the ſcreams of Beatrice

ance of her old ſervant, when, on enter- 
ing the paſſage leading to the hall, three 
men, maſked and muffled up in cloaks, 


appeared, advancing from the oppoſite 


extremity. While ſhe retreated, they 
purſued her to the apartment- ſhe had 
quitted. Her breath and her courage 
were gone, yet ſhe ſtruggled to: ſuſtain 
herſelf, and endeavoured to aſk with 
calmneſs what was their errand: They 
gave no reply, but threw a val over her 
face, and, ſeizing her arms, led her al-

menacing her, not by words, but geſ-

ſupplicated as much as for herſelf ; but 
entreaty was alike unavailing for each;

neſs had now forſaken her. On reco- 
vering, ſhe perceived herſelf in a car- 
Triage, which was driven with great ra- 
pidity, and that her arms were within the 
graſp of ſome perſons, whom, when her 
recollection returned more fully, ſhe be- 
lieved to be the men who had carried 
her from the villa. The darkneſs pre- 
vented her from obſerving their figures, 
and to all her queſtions and entreaties a 
death-like filence was obſerved. 

During the whole night the carriage 
proceeded rapidly, ſtopping only while 
the horſes were changed, when Ellena 
endeavoured to intereſt by her cries the

means that had remained by which ſhe 
could make it known. 

For the firit hours, a tumult of terror 
and amazement occupied her mind, but, 
as this began to ſubſide, and her under- 
ſtanding to recover its clearneſs, grief 
and deſpondency mingled with her fears. 
She ſaw herlſelt ſeparated from Vivaldi, 
probably for ever, tor ſhe apprehended 
that the ſtrong and inviſible hand which 
governed her courſe, would never relin- 
quiſh its graſp till it had placed her irre- 
coverably beyond the reach of her lover. 
A conviction that ſhe ſhould fee him no 
more came, at intervals, with ſuch over- 
whelming force, that every other conſi- 
deration and emotion diſappeared before 
it; and at theſe moments ſhe loſt all. 
anxiety as to the place of her deſtination, 
and all fear as to her perſonal ſafety. 

As the morning advanced and the heat 
increaſed, the blinds were let down a 
little to admit air, and Ellena then per-

ceived, that only two of the men, who 
had appeared at Villa Altieri, were in the 
carriage, and that they were ſtill diſguiſed 
in cloaks and viſors. She had no means 
of judging through what part of the 
country ſhe was travelling, for above the 
ſmall openings which the blinds left ſhe 
could ſee only the towering tops of 
mountains, or ſometimes the veiny pre- 
cipices and tangled thickets, that cloſely 
impended over the road. 

About noon, as ſhe judged from the 
exceſſive heat, the carriage ſtopped at a 
poſt-houſe, and ice-water was handed 
through the window, when, as the blind 
was lowered to admit it, ſhe perceived 
herſelf on a wild and ſolitary plain, ſur- 
rounded by mountains and woods. The 
people at the door of the poſt-houſe 
ſeemed © unuſed to pity or be pitied.” - 
The lean and fallow countenance of po- 


yerty ſtared over their gaunt bones, and 
habitual diſcontent had fixed the furrows 
of 


a8 


of their cheeks. They regarded Ellena 
with only a feeble curioſity, though the 
affliction in her looks might have inte- 
reſted almoſt any heart that was not cor- 
roded by its own ſufferings ; nor did the 
maſked faces of her companions excite a 
much ſtronger attention. 
Ellena accepted the cool refreſhment 
offered her, the firſt ſhe had taken on the 
road. Her companions having emptied 
their glaſſes drew up the blind, and, not- 
withſtanding the almoſt intolerable heat 
of noon, the carriage proceeded. Faint- 
ing under its oppreſſion, Ellena entreated 
that the windows might be open, when 
the men, probably in compliance with 
their own neceſſity rather than with her 
requeſt, lowered the blinds, and ſhe had 
a glimpſe of the lofty region of the 
mountains, but of no obje&amp; that could 
direct her conjecture concerning where 
ſhe was. She ſaw only pinnacles and vaſt 
precipices of various-tinted marbles, in- 
termingled 


C 18a ) 


termingled with ſcanty vegetation, ſuck 
as ſtunted pinaiters, dwarf- oak and holly, 
which gave dark touches to the many- 
coloured cliffs, and ſometimes {ſtretched 
in ſhadowy maſles to the deep vallies, 
that, winding into obſcurity, ſeemed to 
invite curioſity to explore the ſcenes be- 
yond, Below theſe bold precipices ex- 
tended the gloomy region of olive-trees, 
and lower {till other rocky ſteeps ſunk 
towards the plains, bearing terraces 
crowned with vines, and where often 
the artificial foil was propped by thick- 
ets of Indian-fig, pomegranate, and ole- 
ander. 
Ellena, after having been ſo long ſhut 
in darkneſs, and brooding over her own 
alarming circumſtances, found tempora- 
ry, though feeble, relief in once more 
looking upon the face of nature; till, 
her ſpirits being gradually revived and 
elevated by the grandeur of the images 
around her, ſhe ſaid to herſelf, “If I am 


condemned 


9 


condemned to miſery, ſurely I could en- 
dure it with more fortitude in ſcenes like 
theſe, than amidſt the tamer landſcapes 
of nature! Here, the objects ſeem to im- 
part ſomewhat of their own force, their 
own ſublimity, to the foul. It is ſcarcely 
poſſible to yield to the preſſure of misfor- 
tune while we walk, as with the Deity, 
amidſt his moſt ſtupendous works!“ 

But ſoon after, the idea of Vivaldi 
glancing athwart her memory, ſhe melt- 
ed into tears ; the weakneſs however was 
momentary, and during the reſt of the 
journey ſhe preſerved a ſtrenuous equal- 
ity of mind. | 

It was when the heat and the light 
were declining that the carriage entered a 
rocky defile, which ſhewed, as through a 
teleſcope reverſed, diſtant plains, and 
mountains opening beyond, lighted up 
with all the purple ſplendor of the ſetting 
ſun. Along this deep and ſhadowy per- 
ſpeCtive, a river, which was ſeen deſcend- 


ing 


( 184 ) 


ing among the cliffs of a mountain, rolled 
with impetuous force, fretting and foam- 
ing amidſt the dark rocks in its deſcent, 
and then flowing in a limpid lapſe to the 
brink of other precipices, whence again 
it fell with thundering -ſtrength to the 
abyſs, throwing its miſty clouds of ſpray 
high in the air, and ſeeming to claim the 
fole empire of this ſolitary wild. Its bed 
took up the whole breadth of the chaſm, 
which ſome ſtrong convulſion of the earth 
ſeemed to have formed, not leaving ſpace 
even for a road along its margin. The 
road, therefore, was carried high among 
the cliffs, that impended over the river, 
and ſeemed as it ſuſpended in air; while 
the gloom and vaſtneſs of the precipices, 
which towered above and ſunk below it, 
together with the amazing force and up- 
roar of the falling waters, combined to 
render the paſs more terrific than the 
pencil could deſcribe, or language may 
expreſs. Ellena aſcended it, not with in- 
difference 


55 


difference but with calmneſs; the expe- 
rienced ſomewhat of a dreadful pleaſure 
in looking down upon the irreſiſtible 
flood; but this emotion was heightened 
into awe, when ſhe perceived that the 
road led to a flight bridge, which, 
thrown acroſs the chaſm at an immenſe 
height, united two oppoſite cliffs, be- 
tween which the whole cataract of the 
river deſcended. The bridge, which was 
defended only by a ſlender railing, ap- 
peared as if hung amidit the clouds, El- 
lena, while ſhe was croſſing it, almoſt 
forgot her misfortunes. Having reached 
the oppoſite ſide of the glen, the road 
gradually deſcended the precipices for 
about half a mile, when it opened to ex- 
tenſive proſpects over plains and towards 
diſtant mountains-—the ſunſhine land- 
ſcape, which had long appeared to bound 
this ſhadowy pals. The tranſition was 
as the paſſage through the vale of death 
to the bliſs of eternity ; but the idea of 

Its 


( 186 )) 

its reſemblance did not long remain with 
Ellena. Perched high among the cliffs 
of a mountain, which might be ſaid to 
terminate one of the jaws of this terrific 
defile, and which was one of the loftieſt 
of a chain that ſurrounded the plains, 
appeared the ſpires and long terraces of 
a monaſtery ; and ſhe ſoon underſtood 
that her journey was to conclude there. 
At the foot of this mountain her com- 
panions alighted, and obliged her to do 
the ſame, for the aſcent was too ſteep and 
regular to admit of a carriage. Ellena 
followed unreſiſtingly, like a lamb to the 
facrifice, up a path that wound among 
the rocks, and was coolly overſhadowed 
by thickets of almond-trees, figs, broad- 
leaved myrtle, and ever-green roſe buſhes, 
intermingled with the ſtrawberry tree, 
beautiful in fruit and blofloms, the yel- 
low jaſmine, the delightful acacia minigſa, 
and a variety of other fragrant plants. 
Theſe bowers frequently admitted glimp-

ſes of the glowing country below, and 
ſometimes opened to expanſive views 
bounded by the ſnowy mountains of Ab- 
ruzzo. At every ſtep were objects which 
would have afforded pleaſure to a tran- 
quil mind; the beautifully variegated 
marbles, that formed the cliffs imme- 
diately above, their fractured maſſes 
emboſſed with moſſes and flowers of 
every vivid hue that paints the rain- 
bow; the elegance of the ſhrubs that 
tufted, and the majeſtic grace of the 


palms which waved over them, would 


have charmed almoſt any other eye than 
Ellena's, whoſe ſpirit was wrapt in care, 
or than thoſe of her companions, whoſe 
hearts were dead to feeling. Partial fea- 
tures of the vaſt edifice ſhe was approach- 
ing, appeared now and then between the 
trees; the tall weſt window of the cathe- 
dral with the ſpires that overtopped it ; 
the narrow pointed roofs of the cloiſters ; 
angles of the inſurmountable walls, which

tenced the garden from the precipices 
below, and the dark portal leading into 
the chief court; each of theſe, feen at 
intervals bencath the gloom of cypreſs 
and ſpreading cedar, ſeemed as it me- 
nacing the unhappy Ellena with hints of 
future ſuffering. She paſſed ſeveral 
ſhrines and images half hid among the 
ſhrubs and the cliffs ; and, when ſhe drew 
near the monaſtery, her companions ſtop- 
ped at a little chapel which ſtood beſide 
the path, where, after examining ſome 
papers, an act which ſhe obſerved with 
ſurpriſe, they drew aſide, as if to conſult 
reſpecting herſelf, Their converſation 
was delivered in voices ſo low, that ſhe 
could not catch a ſingle tone diſtinctly, 
and it is probable that if ſhe could, this 
would not have aſſiſted her in conjectur- 
ing who they were; yet the profound 
ſilence they had hitherto obſerved had 
much encreaſed her curioſity, now that 
they ſpoke. 

One

One of them ſoon after quitted the 
chapel and proceeded alone to the monaſ- 
tery, leaving Lllena in the cuſtody of his 
comrade, whole pity ſhe now made a laſt, 
though almoſt hopeleſs, effort to intereſt, 
He replied to all her entreaties only by a 
waving of the hand, and an averted face 
and ſhe endeavoured to meet with forti- 
tude and to endure with patience, the 
evil which ſhe could neither avoid nor 
ſubdue. The ſpot where ſhe awaited the 
return of the ruffian, was not of a cha- 
racter to promote melancholy, except, 
indeed, that luxurious and ſolemn kind 
of melancholy, which a view of ſtupen- 
dous objects inſpires. It overlooked the 
whole extent of plains, of which ſhe had 
before caught partial ſcenes, with the vaſt 
chain of mountains, which ' ſeemed to 
form an inſurmountable rampart to the 
rich landſcape at their feet. Their 
towering and fantaſtic ſummits, crowd- 
ing together into duſky air, like flames 

tapering 


Cs. 
tapering to a point, exhibited images of 
peculiar grandeur, while each minuter 
line and feature withdrawing, at this 
evening hour, from obſervation, ſeemed 
to reſolve itſelf into the more gigantic 
maſſes, to which the dubious tint, the 
ſolemn obſcurity, that began to pre- 
vail over them, gave force and loftier 
character. The filence and deep re- 
poſe of the landſcape ſerved to imprek 
this character more awtully on the heart, 
and while Ellena ſat wrapt in the 
thoughtfulneſs it promoted, the veſper- 
ſervice of the monks, breathing ſoftly 
from the cathedral above, came to her 
ear; it was a muſie which might be ſaid 
to win on ſilence, and was in perfect 
uniſon with her feelings; ſolemn, deep, 
and full, it ſwelled in holy peels, and 
rolled away in murmurs, which atten- 
tion purſued to the laſt faint note that 
melted into air. Ellena's heart owned 
the: Powe of this high minſtrelſy; and 


while 


C 91 

while ſhe caught for a moment the 
ſweeter voices of the nuns mingling 
in the choral reſponſe, ſhe indulged a 
hope that they would not be wholly 
inſenſible to her ſufferings, and that 
ſhe ſhould receive ſome conſolation from 
ſympathy as ſoft as theſe tender-breath- 
ing ſtrains appeared to indicate. 
She had reſted nearly half an hour on 
the turfy ſlope before the chapel, when 
ſhe perceived through the twilight two 
monks deſcending from the monaſtery 
towards the ſpot where ſhe ſat. As they 
drew near, ſhe diſtinguiſhed their dreſs 
of grey ſtuff, the hood, the ſhaven head, 
where only a coronet of white hair was 
left, and other enſigns of their particular 
order. On reaching the chapel, they ac- 
coſted her companion, with whom they 
retired a few paces, and converſed. El- 
lena heard, for the firſt time, the ſound 
of her conductor's voice, and though this 
was but faintly, ſhe marked it well. The 
6 other 


( 192 ) 
other ruffian did not yet appear, but 11 
ſeemed evident that theſe friars had left 
the convent in conſequence of his in- 
formation; and ſometimes, when ſhe 
looked upon the taller of the two, 
the fancied ſhe ſaw the perſon of the 
very man whoſe abſence ſhe had re- 
marked, a conjecture which ſtrength- 
ened while ſhe more accurately noticed 
him. The portrait had certainly much 
reſemblance in height and bulk ; and 
the fame gaunt awkwardneſs, which 
even the cloak of the ruffian had not 
entirely ſhrouded, obtruded itſelf from 
under the folded garments of the re- 
cluſe. If .countenance, too, might be 
truſted, this ſame friar had a ruffian's 
heart, and his keen and cunning eye 
ſeemed habitually upon the watch for 
prey. His. brother of the order ſhewed 


nothing ſtrongly characteriſtic either in 
his face or manner. 


After 


. 

After a private convetſation of ſome 
length, the friars approached Ellena, 
and told her, that ſhe muſt accompany 
them to the convent; when her diſ- 
guiſed conductor, having reſigned her 
to them, immediately departed and de- 
ſcended the mountain. 

Not a word was uttered by either of 
the party as they purſued the ſteep tract 
leading to the gates of this ſecluded edi- 
fice, which were opened to them by a 
lay-brother, and Ellena entered a ſpa- 
cious court. Three ſides of this were 
encloſed by lofty buildings, lined with 
ranges of cloiſters; the fourth opened 
to a garden, ſhaded with avenues of 
melancholy cypreſs, that extended to the 
cathedral, whoſe fretted windows and or- 
namented ſpires appeared to cloſe the 
perſpective. Other large and detached 
buildings ſkirted the gardens on the left, 
while, on the right, ſpacious olive- 
grounds and vineyards ſpread to the 

VOL, I. l cliffs 


( 194 ) 
cliffs that formed a barrier to all thi; 
fide of the domain of the convent. ' 
The friar, her conductor, croſſed the 
court to the north wing, and there ring. 
ing a bell, a door was opened by a nun, 
into whoſe hands Ellena was given. A 
ſignificant look was exchanged between 
the devotees, but no words ; the friar 
departed, and the nun, ſtill filent, con- 
ducted her through many ſolitary paſl 
ages, where not even a diſtant foot-fal 
echoed, and whoſe walls were roughly 
painted with ſubjects indicatory of the 
ſevere ſuperſtitions of the place, tending 
to inſpire melancholy awe. Ellena's 
hope of pity vaniſhed as her eyes glancg 
cover theſe ſymbols of the diſpoſition of 
the inhabitants, and on the countenance 
of the recluſe, characteriſed by a gloomy 
malignity, which ſeemed ready to inflict 
upon others ſome portion of the unhap- 
pineſs ſhe herſelf ſuffered, As ſhe glided 
forward with ſoundleſs ſtep, her white 
drapery,

drapery, floating along theſe ſolemn ave- 


nues, and her hollow features touched 
with the mingled light and ſhadow which 
the partial rays of a taper ſhe held occa- 
ſioned, ſhe ſeemed like a ſpectre newly 
riſen from the grave, rather than a liv- 
ing being. Theſe paſſages terminated in 
the parlour of the Abbeſs, where the 
nun pauſed, and, turning to Ellena, ſaid, 


lt is the hour of veſpers; you will 


wait here till our lady of the convent 


leaves the church; ſhe would ſpeak with 


you.“ 755 

« To what ſaint is the convent dedi- 
cated,” ſaid Ellena, and who, ſiſter, 
preſides over it?“ 


The nun gave no reply, and after 
having eyed the forlorn ſtranger for a 
moment, with inquiſitive ill-nature, quit- 
ted the room. The unhappy Ellena had 
not been left long to her own retleCtions, 
when the Abbeſs appeared; a ſtately 

TS lady, 


(196) 


lady, apparently occupied with opinions 
of her own importance, and prepared to 
receive her gueſt with rigour and ſuper- 
cilious haughtineſs. This Abbeſs, who 
was herſelf a woman of ſome diſtinction, 
believed that of all poſſible crimes, next 
to that of ſacrilege, offences againſt per- 
ſons of rank were leaſt pardonable. It is 
not ſurpriſing, therefore, that, ſuppoſing 
Ellena, a young woman of no family, 
to have ſought clandeſtinely to unite her- 
ſelf with the noble houſe of Vivaldi, ſhe 
ſhould feel for her, not only diſdain, but 
indignation, and that ſhe ſhould readily 
conſent, not only to puniſh the offender, 
but, at the ſame time, to afford means of 
preſerving the ancient dignity of the of- 
fended. 

J underſtand,“ ſaid the Abbeſs, on 
whoſe appearance the alarmed Ellena had 
- ariſen, © I underſtand,” ſaid ſhe, with- 
out making any ſignal for her to be

% 2» 
feated, “that you are the young perſon 
who is arrived from Naples.“ 

* My name is Ellena di Roſalba,“ ſaid 
her auditor, recovering ſome degree of 
courage from the manner which was de- 
ſigned to depreſs her. 

I know nothing of your name,” re- 
phed the Superior; *I am informed only 
that you are ſent here to acquire a know- 
ledge of yourſelf and of your duties. Till 
the period ſhall be paſſed, for which you 
are given into my charge, I ſhall ſcru- 
pulouſly obſerve the obligations. of the 
troubleſome office, which my regard for 
the honour of a noble family has induced 
me to undertake.” 

By theſe words, the author and the 
motives of this extraordinary tranſaction 
were at once revealed to Ellena, who was 
for ſome moments almoſt overwhelmed- 
by the ſudden horrors that gathered on 
her mind, and ſtood filent and motion- 
leſs. Fear, ſhame, and indignation al- 


13 ternately 


( 198 ) 

ternately affailed her; and the ſting of 
offended honour, on being ſuſpected, 
and thus accuſed of having voluntarily 
diſturbed the tranquillity, and ſought 
the alliance of any family, and eſpecially 
of one who diſdained her, {truck forcibly 
to her heart; till the pride of conſcious 
worth gradually reviving her courage and 
fortifying her patience, ſhe demanded by 
whoſe will ſhe had been torn from her 
home, and by whoſe authority ſhe way 
now detained, as it appeared, a priſoner, 
The Abbeſs, unaccuſtomed to have her 
power oppoſed, or her words queſtion- 
ed, was for a moment too indignant to 
reply; and Ellena obſerved, but no 
longer with diſmay, the krooding tem- 
peſt ready to burſt over her head. It 
is I only who am injured,” ſaid ſhe to 
herſelf, and ſhall the guilty oppreſſor 
triumph, and the innocent ſufferer ſink 
under the ſhame that belongs only to 
guilt ! Never will I yield to a weakneſs 
"Wy 


(298: -3 


ſo contemptible. The conſciouſneſs of 
deſerving well ſhall recall my preſence 
of mind, which, permitting me to eſti- 
mate the characters of my oppreſſors by 
their actions, will enable me alſo to de- 
ſpiſe their power.“ 

« I muſt remind you,“ ſaid the Ab- 
beſs, at length, © that the queſtions you 
make are unbecoming in your fituation ; 
and that contrition and humility are the 
beſt extenuations of error. You may 
withdraw.” 

&lt;* Moſt true,” replied Ellena, bowing 
with dignity to the Superior; © and I 
moſt willingly reſign them to my op- 
preſſors.“ 

Ellena forbore to make further en- 
quiry or remonſtrance; and perceiving 
that reſiſtance would not only be uſe- 
leſs, but degrading, ſhe immediately 
obeyed the mandate of the Abbeſs, de- 
termined, ſince ſhe mult ſuffer, to ſuffer, 
if poſſible, with firmnels and dignity. 

14 She 


(7.200; ) 


She was conducted from the parlout 
by the recluſe who had admitted her, 
and as ſhe paſſed through the refectory 
where the nuns, juſt returned from vel. 
pers, were atlembled, their inquiſitive 
glances, their ſmiles and buſy whiſpers, 
told her, that ſhe was not only an object 
of curioſity, but of ſuſpicion, and that 
little ſympathy could be expected from 
hearts, which even the offices of hourly 
devotion had not purified from the ma- 
lignant envy, that taught them to exalt 
themſelves upon the humiliation of 
others. | 

The little room, to which Ellena was 
led, and where, to her great ſatisfaction, 
ſhe was left alone, rather deſerved the 
denomination of a cell than of a cham- 
ber; ſince, like thoſe of the nuns, it 
had only one ſmall lattice; and a mat- 
treſs, one chair, and a table, with a cru- 
cifix and a prayer-book, were all its fur- 
niture. Ellena, as ſhe ſurveyed her me- 

| lancholy 


E 


lancholy habitation, ſuppreſſed a riſing 
ſigh, but ſhe could not remain unaffected 
by recollections, which, on this view of 
her altered ſtate, crowded to her mind; 
nor think of Vivaldi far away, perhaps 
for ever, and, probably, even ignorant 
of her deſtination, without bitter tears. 
But ſhe dried them, as the idea of the 
Marcheſa obtruded on her thoughts, for 
other emotions than thoſe of grief poſ- 
felled her. It was to the Marcheſa that 
ſhe eſpecially attributed her preſent ſitua- 
tion; and it now appeared, that the fa- 
mily of Vivaldi had not been reluQant 
only, but poſitively averſe to a connexion 
with hers, contrary to the ſuggeſtion 
of Signora Bianchi, who had repreſent- 
ed, that it might be ſuppoſed only, from 
their known character, that they would 
diſapprove of the alliance, but would of 
courſe be reconciled to an event, which 
their haughtieſt diſpleaſure never could 
revoke. This diſcovery ef their abſolute 


15 rejection 


.

rejection awakened all the proper pride, 
which the miſtaken prudence of her 
aunt, and her affection for Vivaldi, had 
lulled to reſt; and ſhe now ſuffered the 
moſt acute vexation and remorſe, for 
having yielded her conſent to enter clan- 
deſtinely into any family. The imagin- 
ary honours of ſo noble an alliance va- 
niſhed, when the terms of obtaining 
them were conſidered ; and now, that 
the ſound mind of Ellena was left to its 
own judgment, ſhe looked with infinitely 
more pride and preference upon the in- 
duſtrious means, which had hitherto ren- 
dered her independent, than on all diſ. 
tinction which might be reluctantly 
given. The conſciouſneſs of worth, 
which had ſupported her in the pre- 
fence of the Superior, began to falter. 
Her accuſation was partly juſt!“ faid 
Ellena, „and I deſerve puniſhment, 
ſince I could, even for a moment, ſub- 
mit to the humiliation of conſenting to 

an 


( 203 ) 
an alliance, which I knew would be un- 
willingly conferred. But it is not yet 
too late to retrieve my own eſteem by 
aſſerting my independence, and reſign- 
ing Vivaldi for ever. By reſigning him! 
by abandoning him who loves me,— 
abandoning him to miſery! Him, whom 
I cannot even think of without tears, — 
to whom my vows have been given, 
who may claim me by the ſacred” re- 
membrance of my dying friend, —him, 
to whom my whole heart 1s devoted! 
O! miſerable alternative! —that I can no 
longer act juſtly, but at the expence of 
all my future happineſs! Juſtly! And 
would it then be juſt to, abandon him 
who is willing to reſign every thing for 
me, — abandon him tc -ceaſeleis ſorrow, 
that the prejudices of his family may be 
gratified ?””. 

Poor: Ellena perceived that ſhe could 
not obey the dictates of a laudable pride, 


without ſuch oppoſition from her heart 
16 as 


( 204 ) 
as ſhe had never experienced before. 
Her affections were now too deeply en- 
gaged to permit her to act with firmneſs, 
at the price of long- ſuffering. The con- 
ſideration of reſigning Vivaldi was ſo very 
grievous, that ſhe could ſcarcely endure 
to pauſe upon it for a moment; yet, on 
the other hand, when ſhe thought of his 
family, it appeared that ſhe never could 
conſent to make a part of it. She would 
have blamed the erroneous judgment of 
Signora Bianchi, whoſe perſuaſions had 
ſo much aſſiſted in reducing her to the 
preſent alternative, had not the tender- 
neſs with which ſhe cheriſned her memo- 
ry, rendered this impoſſible. All, that 
now remained for her, was to endeavour 
patiently to endure preſent evils, which 
the could not conquer; for, to forſake 
Vivaldi as the price of liberty, ſhould li- 
berty be offered her on ſuch terms, or to 
accept him in defiance of honourable 
pride, ſhould he ever effect her releaſe, 
| appeared 


( 20s ) 


appeared to her diſtracted thoughts al- 
moſt equally impracticable. But, as the 
probability of his never being able to diſ- 
cover her abode, returned to her conſi- 
deration, the anguiſh ſhe ſuffered told 
how much more ſhe dreaded to loſe than 
to accept Vivaldi, and that love was, after 


all, the moſt powerful affection of her 
heart.

SHAKESPEART, 


VivaL pi, meanwhile, ignorant of what 
had occurred at Villa-Altieri, repaired, 
as he had purpoſed, to Paluzzi, attend- 
ed by his ſervant Paulo. It was deep 
night before he left Naples, and ſo 
anxious was he to conceal himſelf from 
obſervation, that though Paulo carried a 
torch, he did not permit it to be lighted, 
till after he ſhould have remained fome 
time within the archway, thinking it 
moſt prudent to watch a while in ſecret 
for his unknown adviſer, before he pro- 
ceeded to examine the fort. 

His attendant, Paulo, was a true Nea- 
politan, ſhrewd, inquiſitive, inſinuating, 
adroit ; poſſeſſing much of the ſpirit of 

intrigue, 


C 207 ) 


intrigue, together with a conſiderable 
portion of humour, which diſplayed it- 
ſelf not ſo much in words, as in his man- 
ner and countenance, in the archneſs of 
his dark, penetrating eye, and in the ex- 
quiſite adaptation of his geſture to his 
idea, He was a diſtinguiſhed favourite 
with his maſter, who, if he had not hu- 
mour himſelf, had a keen reliſh of it in 
others, and who certainly did poſſeſs 
wit, with all its lively accompaniments, 
in an eminent degree. Vivaldi had been 
won by the naivete and humour of this 
man, to allow him an unuſual degree of 
familiarity in converſation ; and, as they 
now walked together towards Paluzzi, 
he unfolded to Paulo as much of his for- 
mer adventure there, as he judged neceſ- 
ſary to intereſt his curioſity and excite his 
vigilance. The relation did both. Paulo, 
however, naturally courageous, was in- 
credulous to ſuperſtition of any kind; 


and, having quickly perceived that his 
maſter 


( 208) 


maſter was not altogether indiſpoſed to 
attribute to a ſupernatural cauſe the ex- 
traordinary occurrences at Paluzzi, he 
began, in his manner, to rally him ; but 
Vivaldi was not in a temper to endure 
jeſting; his mood was grave, even to ſo- 
lemnity, and he yielded, though reluc- 
tantly, to the awe which, at intervals, 
returned upon him with the force of a 
magical ſpell, binding up all his faculties 
to ſternneſs, and fixing them in expect- 
ation. While he was nearly regardlels 
of defence againſt human agency, his 
ſervant was, however, preparing for that 
alone; and very properly repreſented the 
imprudence of going to Paluzzi in dark- 
neſs. Vivaldi obſerved that they could 
not watch for the monk otherwiſe than 
in darkneſs, ſince the torch which lighted 
them would alſo warn him, and he had 
very particular reaſons for watching bc- 
fore he proceeded to examine. He add- 
ed, that after a certain time had elapſed, 

the 


( 209 ) 


the torch might be lighted at a neigh- 
bouring cottage. Paulo objected, that, 
in the meanwhile, the perſon for whom 
they watched might eſcape ; and Vivaldi 
compromiſed the affair. The torch was 
lighted, but concealed within a hollow 
of the clifts, that bordered the road, and 
the centinels took their ſtation in dark- 
neſs, within the deep arch, near the ſpot 
where Vivaldi had watched with Bonar- 
mo. As they did this, the diſtant chime 
of a convent informed Vivaldi that mid- 
night was turned. The ſound recalled 
to his mind the words of Schedoni, con- 
cerning the vicinity of the convent of the 
Black Penitents, to Paluzzi, and he aſked 
Paulo whether this was the chime of that 
convent. Paulo replied that it was, and 
that a remarkable circumſtance had 
taught him to remember the Santa dell 
Pianto, or Our Lady of Tears, © The 
place, Signor, would intereſt you,” ſaid 

Paulo; 


(Cate) 


Paulo; * for there are ſome odd ſtories 
told of it; and I am inclined to think, 
this unknown monk muſt be one of that 
ſociety, his conduct is fo ſtrange.” 

« You believe then, that I am willing 
to give faith to wonderful ſtories,” ſaid 
Vivaldi, ſmiling. But what have you 
heard, that is ſo extraordinary, reſpect- 
ing this convent? Speak low, or we may 
be diſcovered.“ 

„Why, Signor, the ſtory is not gene- 
rally known,” ſaid Paulo in a whiſper ; 
I half promiſed never to reveal it.“ 

Ef you are under any promiſe of ſe- 
creſy,” interrupted Vivaldi, I forbid 
you to- tell this wonderful tale, which, 
however, ſeems ſomewhat too big to reſt 
within your brain.” 

„The ſtory would fain expand itſelf 
to your's, Signor,“ faid Paulo; “ and, 
as I did not abſolutely promiſe to con- 
ceal it, I am very willing to tell it.” 

. | Proceed,

« Proceed, then, ſaid Vivaldi; © but 
let me once more caution you to ſpeak 
low.“ 

« You are obeyed, Signor. You muſt 
know, then, Macro, that it was on the 
eve of the feſtival of Santo Marco, and 
about fix years ſince” 

Peace!“ faid Vivaldi. They were 
filent ; but every thing remaining ſtill, 
Paulo, after ſome time, ventured to pro- 
ceed, though in a yet lower whiſper. 
«It was on the eve of the Santo Marco, 
and when the laſt. bell had rung, that a 
perſon' He ſtopped again, for a ruſt- 
ling ſound paſſed near him. 

“ You are too late,” ſaid a ſudden 
voice beſide Vivaldi, who inſtantly recog- 
nized the thrilling accents of the monk.--- 
* It is paſt midnight; ſhe departed an 
hour ago. Look to your ſteps !” 

Though thrilled by this well-known 
voice, Vivaldi ſcarcely yielded to his 
teelings for a moment, but, checking 

the 


(24S: 


the queſtion which would have afked + 


«© who departed?” he, by a ſudden 
ſpring, endeavoured to ſeize the intrud- 
cr, while Paulo, in the firſt hurry of his 
alarm, fired a piſtol, and then haſtened 
for the torch. So certainly did Vivaldi 
believe himſelf to have leaped up- 
on the ſpot whence the voice proceed- 
ed, that, on reaching it, he inſtantly ex- 
tended his arms, and ſearching around, 
expected every moment to find his ene- 
my in his graſp. Darkneſs again baſlled 
his attempt. 

6 You are known,” cried Vivaldi; 
“ you ſhall ſee me at the Santa dell 
Pianto What, oh! Paulo, the torch |— 
the torch !”? | 


Paulo, ſwift as the wind, appeared 
with it, © He paſſed up thoſe ſteps in 
the rock, Signor ; I ſaw the ſkirts of his 
garments aſcending !”? 

„Follow me, then,” ſaid Vivaldi, 
mounting the ſteps. Away, away, 
Maeſtro.” 


n 


Maęſero“ rejoined Paulo, impatiently ; 
« but, for Heaven's fake, name no 
more the convent of the Santa dell 
Pianto; our lives may anſwer it!“ 


He followed to the terrace above, 
where Vivaldi, holding high the torch, 
looked round for the monk. The place, 
however, as far as his eye could pene- 
trate, was forſaken and filent. The 
glare of the torch enlightened only the 
rude walls of the citadel, ſome points of 
the cliff below, and ſome tall pines that 
waved over them, leaving in doubtful 
gloom many a receſs of the ruin, and 
many a tangled thicket, that ſpread 
among the rocks beyond. 

Do you perceive any perſon, Pau- 
lo!” ſaid Vivaldi, waving the torch in 
the air to rouſe the flame. 

* Among thoſe arches on the left, 
Signor, thoſe arches that ſtand duſkily 
2 beyond the citadel, I thought I ſaw a 
8 ſhadowy ſort of a figure pals. He might

be a ghoſt, by his ſilence, for aught | 
know, Maeſtro; but he ſeems to have 1 
good mortal inſtinct in taking care of 
himſelf, and to have as ſwift a pair of 
heels to aſſiſt in carrying him off, as any 
Lazaro in Naples need deſire.“ 

„ Fewer words, and more caution !” 
ſaid Vivaldi, lowering the torch, and 
pointing it towards the quarter which 
Paulo had mentioned. * Be vigilant, 
and tread lightly.” 

* You are obeyed, Signor; but their 
eyes will inform them, though their ears 
refuſe, while we hold a light to our own 
ſteps.“ 

Peace, with this buffoonery !”* ſail 
Vivaldi, ſomewhat ſternly; “ follow in 
ſilence, and be on your guard.“ 

Paulo ſubmitted, and they proccedel i 
towards the range of arches, which com. 
municated with the building, whoſe {it 
gular ſtructure had formerly arreſted tht 
attention of Bonarmo, and whence Vi 
vald 


(enz) 


valdi himſelf had returned with ſuch un- 
expected precipitancy and conſternation. 

On perceiving the place he was ap- 
proaching, he ſuddenly ſtopped, and 
Paulo obſerving his agitation, and pro- 
bably not reliſhing the adventure, endea- 
voured to diſſuade him from further re- 
ſearch: For we know not who may in- 
habit this gloomy place, Signor, or their 


numbers, and we are only two of us after 


all! Beſides, Signor, it was through that 
door, yonder,“ and he pointed to the 
very ſpot whence Vivaldi had formerly 
iſſued, „through that door, that I fan- 
cied, juſt now, I ſaw ſomething paſs.” 

* Are you certain as to this?“ ſaid 
Vivaldi, with increaſed emotion. © What 
was its form?“ 

&amp; It was ſo duſky thereabout, Maęſtro, 
that I could not diſtinguiſh.” 

Vivaldi's eyes were fixed upon the 
building, and a violent conflict of feel- 
ings ſeemed to ſhake his foul. A few 

"is ſeconds 


(846) 

ſeconds decided it. I will go on,” 
ſaid he, and terminate, at any hazard, 
this ſtate of intolerable anxiety. Paulo, 
pauſe a moment, and conſider well whe- 
ther you can depend on your courage, 
for it may be ſeverely tried. If you can, 
deſcend with me in filence, and I warn 
you to be wary ; if you cannot, I will go 
alone.“ 

ce It is too late now, Signor, to aſk my- 
ſelf that queſtion,” replied Paulo, with a 
ſubmiſſive air; * and if I had not ſettled 
it long ago, I ſhould not have followed 
you thus far. My courage, Signor, you 
never doubted before.“ 

“Come on then,” ſaid Vivaldi. He 
drew his ſword, and entering the narrow 
doorway, the torch, which he had now 
reſigned to Paulo, ſhewed a ſtone paſſage. 
that was, however, interminable to the 
eye. 

As they proceeded, Paulo obſerved, 
that the walls were ſtained in ſeveral 


places 


( 427 3 


places with what appeared to be blood, 
but prudently forbore to point this out to 
his maſter, obſerving the ſtrict injunction 
of ſilence he had received. 

Vivaldi ſtepped cautiouſly, and often 
pauſed to liſten, after which he went on 
with a quicker pace, making ſigns only 
to Paulo to follow, and be vigilant. The 
paſſage terminated in a ſtair- caſe, that 
ſeemed to lead to vaults below. Vivaldi 
remembered the light which had, for- 
merly appeared there, and, as recollec- 
tions of the paſt gathered on his mind, 
he faltered in his purpoſe. 

Again he pauſed, looked back upon 
Paulo, but was once more going forward, 
when Paulo himſelf ſeized his arm. 
„Stop! Signor,“ ſaid he in a low 
voice. ® Do you not diſtinguiſh a 
figure ſtanding yonder, in the gloom ?? 

Vivaldi looking onward; ' perceived,

dulky extremity of the avenue, near the 
Nair-caſe. Its garments, if © garments 
they were, were dark; but its whole 
figure was fo faintly traced to the eye, 
that it was impoſlible to aſcertain whe. 
ther this was the monk. Vivaldi tock 
the light, and held it forward, endea- 
vouring to diſtinguiſh the obje&amp; before 
he ventured further; but the enquiry 
was uſeleſs, and, reſigning the torch to 
Paulo, he ruſhed on. When he reached 
the head of the ſtair-caſe, however, the 
form, whatever it might be, was gone. 
Vivaldi had heard no footſtep. Paulo 
pointed out the exact fpot where it had 
ſtood, but no veſtige of it appeared. Vi- 
valdi called loudly upon the monk, but 
he heard only the lengthening echoes of 
his own voice revolving among the cham- 
bers below, and, after heſitating a while 
on the head of the ſtairs, he deſcended. 

Paulo had not followed down many

Vivaldi purſued fo ſwiftly, that Paulo 
could ſcarcely follow faſt: enough with 
the light ; and, as at length he reſted to 


take breath, he perceived himſelf in the 


fame ſpacious chamber to which he had 
formerly deſcended. At this moment 


Paulo obſerved his countenance change. 


« You are ill, Signor,“ faid he. In 
the name of our holy Saint, let us quit 
this hideous place ! Its inhabitants can be 
nothing. good, and no good can come ot 


our remaining here.“ 


Vivaldi made no reply; ; he drow breath 


with difficulty, and his eyes remained fix- 


ed on the ground, till a noife, like the 


ereaking-of a heavy hinge, roſe in a diſ- 
tant part of the vault. Paulo turned his 


yes, at the ſame inſtant, towards the 


place whence-it-came, and they both per-

ed. Each believed, from the tranſient 
view he had of it, that this was the ſame 
figure which had appeared on the ſtair- 
caſe, and that it was the monk himſelf. 
Re- animated by this belief, Vivaldi's 
nerves were inſtantly rebraced, and he 
ſprang to the door, which was unfaſten- 
ed, and yielded immediately to his im- 
petuous hand. © You ſhall not deceive 
me now,” cried he, as he entered ; 
&amp; Paulo! keep guard at the door!“ 
He looked round the ſecond vault, in 
which he now found himſelf, but no per- 
ſon appeared; he examined the place, 
and particularly the walls, without diſ- 
covering any aperture, either of door or 
window, by which the figure could have 
quitted the chamber; a ſtrongly-grated 


caſement, placed near the roof, was all 
that 


(231 


that admitted air, and probably light. 
Vivaldi was aſtoniſhed ! * Have you ſeen 
any thing paſs ?” ſaid he to Paulo. 
„Nothing, Maz/tro,” replied the ſer-

«« 'This is almoſt incredible,“ exclaimed 
Vivaldi; „tis certain, this form can be 
nothing human!“ | 
If ſo, Signor, obſerved Paulo, 
„ why ſhould it fear us? as ſurely it 
does; or why ſhould it have fled?” 
That is not ſo certain,” rejoined Vi- 
valdi ; © it may have fled only to lead us 
into evil. But bring hither the torch ; 
here is ſomething in the wall which I 
would examine.“ | 
Paulo obeyed. It was merely a rug- 
gedneſs in the ftones, not the partition 
of a door, that had excited his curioſity.

* This is inexplicable!” exclaimed Vi- 


valdi, after a long pauſe. © What mo- 
tive could any human being have for 


thus tormenting me.“ | 
K 3 cc Or 


( 222 - } 


« Or any being ſuperhuman, either, 
my Signor?“ ſaid Paulo. 

Jam warned of evik that await me,“ 
continued Vivaldi, muſing ; of events 
that are regularly fulfilled ; the being 
who warns me, crofles my path perpe- 
tually, yet, with the cunning of a de- 
mon, as conſtantly eludes my graſp, and 
baffles my purſuit ! It is incemprehen- 
ſible, by what means he glides thus away 
from my eye, and fades, as if into air, 
at my approach! He is repeatedly in my 
preſence, yet is never to be found!“ 

It is moſt true, Signor, ſaid Paulo, 
c that hie is never to be found, and. there- 
fore let me entreat you to give up the 
purſuit. This place is enough to make 
one believe in the horrors of purgatory ! 
Let us go, Signor.“ 

What but ſpirit could have quitted 
this vault ſo myſteriouſly,” continued Vi- 
valdi, not attending to Paulo; * what 
but ſpirit!

vant, „that ſubſtance can quit it as

He had ſcarcely ſpoken the words, 
when. the door cloſed, with a thundering 
clap that echoed through all the vaults ; 
Vivaldi and Paulo ſtood for a moment 
agllaſt! and then both haſtened to 
open it, and to leave the place. Their 
conſternation may be eaſily conceived, 
when they found that all their efforts at 
the door were ineffectual. The thick 
wood was inlaid with ſohd barg of iron ; 
and was of ſuch unconquerable ſtrength, 
that it evidently guarded what had been 
deſigned for a priſon, and appeared to

valdi; “a truce with this nonſenſe, and

Vivaldi again examined the walls, and 
as unfucceſsfully as before; but in one 
corner of the vault lay an object, which 
ſeemed to tell the fate of one who had 
been confined here, and to hint his own; 
it was a garment covered with blood. 
Vivaldi and his ſervant diſcovered it at 
the ſame inſtant; and a dreadful fore- 
boding of their own deſtiny fixed them, 
for ſome moments, to the ſpot. Vivaldi 
firſt recovered himſelf, when inſtead of 
yielding to deſpondency, all his faculties

eſcaping ; but Paulo's hopes ſeemed bu- 
ried beneath the dreadful veſtments upon 
which he ſtill gazed. © Ah, my Sig- 
nor! 1" ſaid he, at length, in a faltering 
accent, c who ſhall dare to raiſe that gar- 
ment? What if it ſhould conceal, the 
mangled body whoſe blood has ſtained 
it!“ 

Vivaldi, ſhudderingly, turned to look 
on it again. 

© It moves!” exclaimed Paulo; I 
fee it move!“ as he ſaid which, he ſtart- 
ed to the oppoſite fide of the chamber. 
Vivaldi ſtepped a few paces Back, and as 
quickly returned; when, determined to 
know the event at once, he raiſed the 
garment upon the point of his ſword, 
and, -perceived, beneath, other remains 
of dreſs, - heaped high together, while 
even the floor below was ſtained with 


gore. | | 
K 5 Believing 


( 226 ) 


Believing that fear had deceived the 
eyes of Paulo, Vivaldi watched this hor- 
rible ſpectacle for ſome time, but with- 
out perceiving the leaſt motion; when 
he became convinced, that not any re- 
mains of life were ſhrouded beneath it, 
and that it contained only articles of 
dreſs, which had belonged to ſome un- 
fortunate perſon, who had probably been 
decoyed hither for plander, and after- 

wards murdered. This belef, and the 
repugnance he felt to dwell upon the 
ſpectacle, prevented him from examin- 
ing further, and he turned away to a re- 
mote part of the vault. A conviction of 
his own fate, and of his ſervant's, filled 
his mind for a while with defpair. It ap- 
peared that he had been enſnared by 
robbers; till, as he recollected the cir- 
cumſtances which had attended his en- 
trance, and the ſeveral peculiar occur- 
rences connected with the arch-way, this 


conjecture 


© 227 ) 

conjecture ſeemed, highly improbable. 
It was unreaſonable, that robbers ſhould 
have taken the trouble to decoy, when 
they might at firſt have ſeized him; ſtill 
more ſo, that they would have perſevered 
fo long in the attempt; and moſt of all, 
that, when he had formerly been in their 
power, they ſhould have neglected their 
opportunity, and ſuffered him to leave 
the ruin unmoleſted. Yet, granting that 
all this, improbable as it was, were, how- 
ever, poſſible, the folemn warnings and 
predictions of the monk, ſo frequently 
delivered, and fo. faithfully fulfilled, 
could have no connection with the 
ſchemes of banditti. It, appeared, there- 
fore, that Vivaldi was, not in the hands 
of robbers; or, if he were, that the 
monk, at leaſt; had no connection with 
them; yet it was certain that he had juſt 
heard the voice of this monk beneath the 
arch; that his ſervant had ſaid, he ſaw 
the veſtments of one aſcending the ſteps 

k 6 of 


(-- #88 


of the fort; and that they had both rea- 
ſon, as; to believe it was his ſha- 
dowy figure, which they had purſued to 
the very chamber where _ were now 
- confined. 

As Vivaldi conſidered al theſe circum- 
ſtances, his perplexity encreaſed, and he 
was more than ever inclined to believe, 
that the form, which had aſſumed the ap- 
pearance of a monk, was ſomething ſu- 
perhuman. 

If this being had appeared only,” 
ſaid he to himſelf, I ſhould, perhaps, 
have thought it the perturbed ſpirit of 
him, who doubtlef&amp;has been murdered 
here, and that it fed: me hither to diſco- 
ver the deed, that his bones might be re- 
moved to holy ground; but this monk, 

or whatever it is, was neither ſilent, nor 
apparently anxious concerning himſelt ; 

he ſpoke only of events connected with 
my peace, and predicted of the future, as 
well as reverted to the paſt! If he had 
— I either 


| ( 229 ) 
either hinted of himſelf, or had been 


wholly ſilent, his appearance, and man- 


ner of eluding purſuit, is ſo extraordi- 
nary, that I ſhould have yielded, for 
once, perhaps, to the tales of our grand- 
fathers, and thought he was the my 
of a murdered perſon.” 

As Vivaldi expreſſed his incredulity 
however, he returned to examine the gar- 
ment once more, when, as he raiſed it, 
he obferved, what had before eſcaped 
his notice, black drapery mingled with 
the heap beneath ; and, on lifting this 
alſo on the point of his ſword, he per- 
ceived part of the habiliment of a monk 
He ſtarted at the diſcovery, as it he had 
ſeen the apparition, which had ſo long 
been tempting his credulity. Here. were

ment, he let t m drop upon the heap; 
when Paulo, who had been filently ob- 
ſerving him, exclaimed,

of the demon who led us hither. Is it a 
winding - ſheet for us, Maęſtro; or was it 
one for the _ he inhabited while on 
earth?“ 

Neither, I trult, 25, replied Vivaldi, 
endeavouring to command the perturba- 
tion he ſuffered, and turning from the 
ſpectacle; therefore we will try once 
more to regain our liberty.“ 

This was a deſign, however, beyond 
his accompliſhment ; and, having again 
attacked the door, raiſed Paulo to the 
grated window, and vociferated for re- 
teaſe with his utmoſt ſtrength, in which 
he was very ably ſeconded by Paulo, he 
abandoned, for the preſent, all further at- 
tempts, and, weary and deſponding, threw 
himſelf on the ground of the dungeon. 

Paulo bitterly lamented. his maſter's 
raſhneſs in penetrating to this remote 
ipot, and bewailed the probability v1 
their being famiſhed. 


For,

« For, ſuppoſing, Signor, that we were 
not decoyed hither for plunder and butch- 
ery, and ſuppoſing that we are not ſur- 
rounded by malicious ſpirits, which San 
Januarius forbid I ſhould take upon me 
to affirm is impoſſible ! ſuppoſing all this,

under ground, as this is?“ 

f Thou art an excellent comforter,”* 
fad Vivaldi, groaning. 

* You muſt allow, Signor, that you 
are even with me,” replied Paulo; * and 
that you are as excellent a conductor.“ 

Vivaldi gave no anſwer, but lay on 
the ground, abandoned to agonizing 
thought. He had now leiſure to conſi- 
der the late words of the monk, and to 
conjecture, for he was in a mood for 
conjecturing the worſt, that they not

ture which diſpelled almoſt all apprehen-

ground, and paced his priſon with quick

a heavy deſpondeney that oppreſſed him. 
but an acute anxiety that ſtung him, 
and, with the tortures of ſuſpenſe, 
brought alſo thoſe of paſſionate impa- 
tience and horror concerning. the fate 
of Ellena. The longer he dwelt. upon 
the poſſibility of her death, the more pro- 
bable it appeared. This monk had al- 
ready forewarned him of the death of 
Bianchi; and when he recollected the 
ſuſpicious circumſtances which had at- 
tended it, his terrors for Ellena increal-

Paulo forgot, for a while, his oun 
ſituation in the ſuperior ſufferings of his 
maſter, and now, at leaſt, endeavoured 
to perform the offices of a comforter, 
for he tried to calm Vivaldi's mind, by 
ſelecting the faireſt circumſtances for 
hope which the ſubject admitted, and he 
paſſed without noticing, or, if noticing, 
only lightly touched upon, the moſt pro- 
minent poſſibilities of evil. His maſter, 
however, was inſenſible to all he ſaid, 
till he mentioned again the convent del

connected with the monk, who had hint- 
ed the fate 'of Ellena, intereſted the un- 
happy Vivaldi, who withdrew awhile 
from his own reflections, to liſten to 
a recital which might aſſiſt his conjec 
tures. | 

Paulo complied with his command, 
but not without reluctance, He looked

round the empty. vault, as if he feared 
that ſome perſon might be lurking in 
the obſcurity, who would overhear, and 
even anſwer him. | 

“ We are tolerably retired herc, too, 
Signor, ſaid he, recollecting himſelf ; 
one may venture to talk ſecrets with 
little danger of being diſcovered. How- 
ever, Mae/tro, it is beſt to make matters 
quite ſure; and therefore, if you will 
pleaſe to take a feat on the ground, | 
will ſtand beſide you and relate all 
know of the convent of Our Lady f 
Tears, which is not much after all.“ 

Vivaldi, having ſrated himſelf, and. 
bidden Paulo do the fame, the ſervant 
began in a low voice——-* It was on 
the vigit of Sa» Marco, juſt after the 
laſt veſper-bell had tolled—You nevcr

ceaſed, that a perſon, ſo muffled up, 
that neither face nor ſhape could be di- 
itinguiſhed, came and placed himſelf on 
the ſteps of one of the boxes adjoining 
the confeſſional chair; but if he had 
been as airily dreſſed as yourſelf, Signor, 
he might have been juſt as well conceal- 
ed; for that duſky aiſſe is lighted only 
by one lamp, which hangs at the end 
next the painted window, except when 
the tapers at the ſhrine of San Antonio 
happen to be burning at the other ex- 
tremity, and even then the place is almoſt 
as gloomy as this vault. But that is, no 
doubt, contrived for the purpoſe, that 
people may not bluſn for the ſins they 
confeſs; and, in good faith, this is an 
accommodation which may bring more 
money to the poor's box, for the 
monks have a ſhrewd eye that way,

* You have dropt the thread of your 
ſtory,” ſaid Vivaldi. | 
„True, Signor, let me recollect where 
I loſt it. Oh! at the ſteps of the confeſ- 
ſional the ſtranger knelt down upor: 
them, and for ſome time poured ſuch 
groans into the ear of the confeſſor, as 
were heard all along the aiſle. You are 
to know, Signor, that the brothers of 
the Santa del Pianta are of the order of 
Black Penitents; and people who {have 
more ſins than ordinary to confeſs, ſome- 
times go there, to conſult with the grand 
penitentiary what is to be done. Now it 
happened, that Father Anſaldo, the grand 
penitentiary himſelf, was in the chair, as 
is cu/tomary on the vigil of the Sarto 
Marco; and he gently reproved the peri- 
tent for bewailing ſo loud, and bade him 
take comfort ; when the other replied) 
enly by a groan deeper than before, but 
it was not ſo loud, and then proceeded

to confeſs. But what he did confeſs, Sig- 


nor, I know not; for the confeſſor, you 
know, never muſt divulge, except, in- 
deed, on very extraordinary occaſions. 
It was, however, ſomething ſo very 
ſtrange and horrible, that the grand pe- 
nitentiary ſuddenly quitted the chair, 


and before he reached the cloiſters he 


fell into ſtrong convulſions. On reco- 
vering himſelf, he aſked the people about 


him, whether the penitent, who had vi- 
ſited ſuch a confeſſional, naming it, was 


gone; adding, that if he was ſtill in the 


church, it was proper he ſhould be de- 
tained. He deſcribed, : at the ſame time, 


as well as he could, the ſort of figure he 
had dimly ſeen approaching the confeſ- 
ſonal juſt before he had received the con- 
feſſion, at recollocting which, he ſeemed 
ready to go off again into his convulſions.

a tall figure, muffled up in the habit of 2 
white friar, gliding ſwiftly along the aiſle, 

towards the door which opened into the 
outer court of the convent; but he was 
himſelf too much engaged to notice the 
ſtranger particularly. Father Anſaldo 
thought this muſt be the perſon; and 
the porter was ſummoned, and aſked 
whether he had obſerved ſuch an one 
- paſs. - He aftirmed that he had not ſeen 
any perſon go forth from the gate within 
the laſt quarter of an hour; which might 
be true enough, you know, Signor, if the 
rogue had been off his poſt. But he fur- 
ther ſaid, that no one had entered, dur- 
ing the whole evening, habited in white.

has ſuch a wretch as I to do with fear ? 
O, Ellena, Ellena!“ 


He inſtantly called loudly to the per- 
fons whom he believed he had heard,

continued vociferations availed them no- 
thing; no anſwer was returned; and 
even the indiſtinct ſounds, which had 
awakened their attention, were heard no 
more. LETT 

At length, exhauſted by their efforts, 
they laid down on the floor of the dun-

at eſcape till the morning light might

Vivaldi had no further ſpirits to en- 
quire for the remainder of Paulo's nar- 
rative. Almoſt deſpairing for himſelf, 
be could not feel an intereſt concerning 
ſtrangers ;

CHAP. VIII. 


Who may ſhe be that ſteals through yonder cloiſtcy, 
And, as the beam of evening tints her veil, 
Unconſciouſly diſcloſes ſaintly features, 
Inform'd with the high ſoul of ſaintly virtue? 


Doss ſeveral days after Ellena's 
arrival at the monaſtery of San Stefano, 
ſhe was not permitted to leave her room. 
The door was locked upon her, and not 
any perſon appeared except a nun, who 
brought her a ſcanty portion of food, 
and who was the ſame that had firſt ad- 
mitted her into that part of the convent 
appropriated to the abbeſs, 

On the fourth day, when, probably, 
it was believed that her ſpirits were ſub- 
dued by confinement, and by her expe- 
rience of the ſuffering ſhe had to expect 


from reſiſtance, ſhe was ſummoned to 
the 


G 


the parlour. The abbeſs was alone, and 
{he air of auſterity, with which ſhe re- 
carded Ellena, prepared the latter to 
endure. 

After an exordium on the heinouſneſs 


of her offence, and the neceſſity there 


was for taking meaſures to prote&amp; the 
peace and dignity of a noble family, 
which her late conduct had nearly de- 
ſtroyed; the Superior informed her, that 
ſhe muſt determine either to accept the 
veil, or the perſon whom the Marcheſa 
di Vivaldi had, of her great goodneſs, 
ſelected for her huſband. 

« You never can be ſufficiently grate- 
ful,“ added the abbeſs, “for the gene- 
roſity the Marcheſa diſplays, in allowing 
vou a choice on the ſubject. After the 
injury you have endeavoured to inflict 
upon her and her family, you could not 
expect that any indulgence would be 
mewn you. It was natural to ſuppoſe, 
that the Marcheſa would have puniſhed

you with ſeverity ; inſtead of which, ſhe 
allows you to enter into our ſociety ; or, 
if you have not ſtrength of mind ſuffi. 
cient to enable you to renounce a ſinful 
world, ſhe permits you to return into it, 
and gives you a ſuitable partner to ſup- 
port you through its cares and toils, —a 
partner much more according with your 
circumſtances than him, to whom you 
had the temerity to lift your eye.” 
Ellena bluſhed at this coarſe appeal to 
her pride, and perſevered in a diſdainful 
ſilence, Thus to give to injuſtice the co- 
louring of mercy, and to acts moſt abſo- 
lutely tyrannical the ſoftening tints of 
generoſity, excited her honeſt indigna- 
tion. She was not, however, ſhocked 
by a diſcovery of the deſigns formed 
againſt her, ſince, from the moment ot 
her arrival at San Stefano, ſhe had ex- 
pected ſomething terribly ſevere, and had 
prepared her mind to meet it with fort!- 


tude ; for ſhe believed, that, ſo ſupport- 
| ed. 


(- 247 } 
ek, ſhe ſhould weary the malice of her 
enemies, and finally triumph over miſ- 
fortune. It was only when ſhe thought 
of Vivaldi that her courage failed, and 
that the injuries ſhe endured ſeemed too 

heavy to be long ſuſtained. 
“Nou are filent!” ſaid the abbeſs, 
after a pauſe of expectation. is it poſ- 


ſible, then, that you can be ungrateful 


for the generoſity of the Marcheſa ? But, 
though you may at preſent be inſenſible 
to her goodneſs, I will forbear to take 
advantage of this inſenſibility, and will 
ſtill allow you liberty of choice. You 
may retire to your chamber, to conſider 
and to decide. But remember, that you 
muſt abide by the determination you 
ſhall avow ; and that you will be allow- 
ed no appeal from the alternatives which 
are now placed before you. —lf you re- 
ject the veil, you mult accept the huſ- 
band who. js offered you.” 

I. 4 «It 


( 248 ) 


&lt; It is unneceflary,” ſaid Ellena, with 
an air of dignified tranquillity, “ that J 
ſhould withdraw for the purpoſes of con- 
ſidering and deciding. My reſolution is 
already taken, and I reject each of the 
offered alternatives. I will neither con- 
demn myſelf to a cloiſter, or to the de- 
gradation with which I am threatened on 
the other hand. Having ſaid this, I am 
prepared to meet whatever ſuffering you 
ſhall inflit upon me; but be aſſured, 
that my own voice never ſhall ſanction 
the evils to which I may be ſubjected, 
and that the immortal love of juſtice, 
which fills all my heatt, will ſuſtain my 
courage no leſs powerfully than the ſenſe 
of what is due to my own character. You 
are now acquainted with my ſentiments 
and my reſolutions ; I ſhall repeat them 
no more.” Shen 


The abbeſs, whoſe ſurpriſe had thus 
long ſuffered Ellena to ſpeak, ſtill fixed 
| upon 


( 249) 


upon her a ſtern regard, as ſhe faid, 
% Where is it that you have learned theſe 
heroics, and acquired the raſhneſs which 
thus prompts you to avow them!—the 
boldneſs which enables you to infult your 
Superior, a prieſteſs of your holy reli- 
gion, even in her ſanctuary!“ 

« The ſanctuary is prophaned,“ ſaid 
Ellena, mildly, but with dignity : © it 
is become a priſon. It 1s only when the 
Superior ceaſes to reſpect the precepts of 
that holy religion, the - precepts which 
teach her juſtice and benevolence, that 
ſhe herſelf is no longer reſpected. The 
very ſentiment which bids us revere its 
mild and beneficent laws, bids us alſo re- 
ject the violators of them: when you 
command me to reverence my religion, 
you urge me to condemn yourſelf.” “ 

&amp;« Withdraw !”” ſaid the abbeſs, riſing 
impatiently from her chair; “ your ad- 
monition, fo becomingly delivered, ſhall 
not be forgotten.” # 

1. 5 Ellena 


( 250 ) 

Ellena willingly obeyed, and was led 
back to her cell, where ſhe fat down 
penſively, and reviewed her conduct. 
Her judgment approved of the franknels, 
with which ſhe had aſſerted her rights, 
and of the firmneſs, with which ſhe had 
reproved a woman, who had dared to de- 
mand reſpect from the very victim of her 
cruelty and oppreſſion. She was the 
more ſatisfied with herſelf, becauſe ſhe 
had never, for an inſtant, forgotten her 
own dignity ſo far, as to degenerate into 
the yehemence of paſſion, or to falter 
with the weakneſs of fear. Her convic- 
tion of the abbeſs's unworthy character 
was too clear to allow Ellena to feel 
abaſhed in her preſence ;. for ſhe regard- 
ed only. the cenſure of the good, to which 
the had ever. been as tremblingly alive, as 
the was obdurately lene to that of 
the vicious. 

Fllena, having now aſſerted her * 


lutions, determined to avoid, if poſſible, 
all 


* — 


— 


E 

alk repetition of ſcenes like the laſt, and 
to repel by ſilence only, whatever indig- 
nity. might be offered her. She knew 
that ſhe muſt ſuffer, and ſhe reſolved to 
endure. Of the three evils, which were 
placed before her, that of confinement,, 
with all its melancholy accompaniments, 
appeared conſiderably leſs ſevere, than 
either the threatened marriage, or a for- 
mal renunciation of the world; either of. 
which would devote her, during life, to 
miſery, and that by her own act. Her 
choice, therefore, had been eaſy, and. 
the way was plain before her. If ſhe 
could ſupport with calmneſs the hard- 
ſhips which ſhe could not avoid, half their 
weight would be unfelt; and ſhe now 
molt ſtrenuouſſy endeavoured to attain 
the ſtrength of mind, which-was neceſ- 
lary for the practice of ſuch equanimity.. 

For ſeveral. days after the late inter- 
view with the abbeſs, ſhe was kept a 


cloſe priſoner ;. but on the fifth evening 
: L 6 ſhe 


( 252. -) 


ſhe was permitted to attend veſpers. As 
ſhe walked through the garden to the 
chapel, the ordinary freſhneſs of the open 
air, and the verdure of the trees and 
ſhrubs, were luxuries to her, who had fo 
long been reſtricted. from the common 
bleſſings of nature. She followed the 
nuns to a chapel where they uſually per. 
formed their religious duties, and was 
there ſeated among the novices. © The ſo- 
lemnity of the ſervice, and particularly 
of thoſe parts which were accompanied 
by muſic, touched all her heart, and 
foothed and elevated her ſpirit. 
- Among the voices of the choir, was 
one 'whoſe expreſſion immediately fixed 
her attention; it ſeemed to ſpeak a loftier 
ſentiment of devotion than the others, 
and to be modulated by the melancholy 
of an heart, that had long ſince taken 
leave of this world. Whether it ſwelled 
with the high peal of the organ, or min- 
gled in low andtrembling accents with the 
ſinking 


( 253 ) 
ſinking chorus, Ellena felt that ſhe un- 
derſtood all the feelings of the breaſt 
from which it flowed ; and ſhe looked to 
the gallery where the ſiſters were affem- 
bled, to diſcover a countenance that 
might ſeem to accord with the ſenſi- 
bility expreſſed in the voice. As no 
ſtrangers were admitted to the chapel, 
ſome of the devotees had thrown back 
their veils, and ſhe ſaw little that inte- 
reſted her in their various faces ; but the 
figure and attitude of a nun, kneeling in 
à remote part of the gallery, beneath a 
lamp, which threw its rays aflant her 
head, perfectly agreed with the idea ſhe 
had formed of the finger, and the found 
ſeemed to approach immediately from 
that direction. Her face was concealed 
by a black veil, whoſe tranſparency, how- 
ever, permitted the fairneſs of her com- 
plexion to appear ; but the air of her 
head, and the ſingularity of her attitude, 
RO IR de tor 


( 254 Þ 
for ſhe was the only perſon who remained 
kneeling, ſufficiently indicated the ſupe- 
rior; degree of fervency and penitence 
which the voice had expreſſed. 

When the hymn had ceaſed, he roſe 
15 her knees, and. Ellena, ſoon after, 
obſerving her throw back her veil, diſco- 
vered, by the lamp, which ſhed its full 
light upon her features, a countenance, 
that inſtantly confirmed her conjecture. 
It was touched with a melancholy kind of 
reſignation; yet grief ſeemed ſtill to oc- 
caſion the paleneſs, and the air of lan- 
guor, that prevailed over it, and which 
diſappeared only when the momentary 
energy of devotion ſeemed to lift her ſpi- 
rit above this world, and to impart to it 
ſomewhat of a ſeraphic grandeur. At 
thoſe moments her blue eyes were raiſed 
towards Heaven, with ſuch meek, yet fer- 
vent love, ſuch ſublime enthuſiaſm as the 
heads of Guido ſometimes diſplay, and 
which 


( 255 ) 
which renewed, with Ellena, all the en- 
chanting effect of the voice ſhe had: juſb 
heard. | | | 

While ſhe regarded the. nun with a 
degree of intereſt which rendered her 
inſenſible to every other object in the 
chapel, the fancied ſhe could perceive 
the calmneſs in her countenance to be 
that of deſpair, rather than of reſigna- 
tion; for, when her thoughts were not 
elevated in prayer, there was frequently a 
fixedneſs in her look, too energetic for 
common ſuffering, or for the temper of 
mind, which may lead to perfect reſigna- 
tion. It had, however, much that at- 
tached the ſympathy of Ellena, and much 
that ſeemed to ſpeak a ſimilarity of feel- 
ing. Ellena was not only ſoothed, but 
in ſome degree comforted, while. ſhe 
gazed upon her; a ſelfiſnneſs which may, 
perhaps, be pardoned, when it is conſi- 
dered, that ſhe thus knew there was one 


human being, at leaſt, in the convent,

hom to meet her eye, that ſhe

voted, that ſhe did not ſucceed.

with a mixture of curioſity and compa!- 
ſion. A faint bluth croſſed her cheek.

unwilling to withdraw her eyes from El- 
lena : but it was neceſſary that ſhe ſhould 
continue in the proceſſion, and, bidding 
her farewel by a ſmile of ineffable pity, 
ſhe paſſed on to the court, while Ellena

doorway of the abbeſs's apartment, and 
Ellena had nearly reached her own, be- 


fore her thoughts were ſufficiently dif- 


engaged to permit her to enquire: the 
name of the ſtranger. 

« It is ſiſter Olivia whom you mean, 
perhaps,“ ſaid her conductreſs. 


« She is very handſome, ſaid Ellena. 
Many of the ſiſters are ſo,” replied 


Margaritone, with an air of pique. .

countenance ; frank, noble, full of ſenſi- 
bility ; and there is a gentle mt il 
in her eye, which cannot but intereſt a

Ellena was fo faſcinated by this inte- 


reſting nun, that ſhe forgot ſhe was de- 
ſcribing her to a perſon, whoſe callous 
heart rendered her inſenſible to the in- 
fluence of any rg except, per- 


haps, the commanding one of che lady

felt, was as unintelligible as would have 
been an Arabic inſcription.

Ellena, raiſing her eyes almoſt uncon- 
ſciouſly, as the nun ſpoke this, fixed 
them upon a face ſallow, meagre, ſeem- 
ingly near fifty years an inhabitant of 
this world; and ſhe could ſcarcely con-

fuch, wretched vanity lingering among

ted all further enquiry, and, having at- 
tended Ellena to her cell, locked her up 
for the night. 

On the following evening Ellena was 
again permitted to attend veſpers, and, 
on the way to the chapel, the hope of 
ſeeing her intereſting fayourite reanimat- 
ed her ſpirits, In the ſame part of the 
gallery, as on the preceding night, ſhe 
again appeared, and kneeling, as before, 
beneath the lamp, in private oriſon, for 
the ſervice was not begun. 

Ellena endeavoured to ſubdue the im- 


patience ſhe felt to expreſs her regard, 


and to be. noticed by the holy ſiſter, till 
ſhe ſhould have finiſhed. When the nun 
roſe, and obſerved Ellena, ſhe lifted her 
vell, and, fixing on her the ſame enquir- 
ing eye, her countenance brightened into 
a ſmile fo full of compaſſion and intelli- 
gence, that Ellena, forgetting the deco- 
rum of the place, left her ſeat to ap- 
_ proach her; it ſeemed as if the ſoul,

which beamed forth in that ſmile, had 
long been acquainted with her's. As ſhe 
advanced, the nun dropped her vel, a 
reproof which ſhe immediately under- 
ſtood, and ſhe withdrew to her ſeat ; but 
her attention remained fixed on the re- 
cluſe during the whole ſervice. 

At the concluſion, when they left the 
chapel, and ſhe faw Olivia paſs without 
noticing her, Ellena could ſearcely re- 
ſtrain her tears; ſhe returned in deep 
dejection to her room. The regard of 
this nun was not only delightful, but 
ſeemed neceſſary to her heart, and ſhe 
dwelt, with fond perſeverance, on the 
imile that had expreſſed fo much, and 
which threw one gleam of comfort, even 
through the bars of her prifon. ' 

Her reverie was ſoon interrupted by 
a light ſtep, that approached her cell, 
and in the next moment the door was 
unlocked, and Olivia herſelf appeared. 
Ellena roſe with emotion to meet her ; 

the

the nun held forth her hand to receive 
her s. 

„Lou are unuſed to confinement,” 
ſaid ſhe, mournfully, and placing on the 
table a little baſket containing refreſh-

a look expreſſive of her gratitude ; © you

ſoftening the ſorrows of others, by any 
attention that may tell them your ſympa- 
thy. O! if 1 could expreſs how much 
the ſenſe of this affects me!“ 

Tears interrupted her. Olivia preſſed 
her hand, looked ſteadily upon her face, 


and was ſomewhat agitated ; but ſhe ſoon 


recovered apparent tranquillity, and faid, 
with a ſerious ſmile, © You judge right- 
ly, my ſiſter, reſpecting my ſentiments, 
however you may err concerning my 
ſufferings. My heart is not inſenſible to

She checked herſelf as if ſhe had al. 
lowed too much, and then added, But 
you may, perhaps, be peaceful; and 
fince it conſoles you to know that you 
have a friend near you, believe me that 
Friend—but believe it in ſilence. I will

a tremulous voice. How ſweet too it 
is! you will viſit me, and I am w pitied by 
you! 197

The nun turned her own away ſuddenly, 
and, preſſing her hand in ſilence, left the 
cell. Ellena, firm and tranquil under 
the inſults of the abbeſs, was now melted 
into tears by the kindneſs of a friend. 
Theſe gentle tears were refreſhing to her 
long- oppreſſed ſpirits, and ſhe indulged 


them. Of Vivaldi the thought with 


more compoſure than ſhe had done ſince 
ſhe left Altieri; and ſomething like hope 
began to revive in her heart, though re- 
fleQion offered little to ſupport it. 

On the following morning, ſhe per- 
ceived that the door of her cell had not 
been cloſed. She roſe impatiently, and, 
not without a hope of liberty, imme- 
diately paſſed it. The cell, opening up- 
on a ſhort paſſage, which communicated 
with the main building, and which was 
ſhut up by a door, was ſecluded, and al- 
moſt inſulated from every other cham- 
ber; and this door being now ſecured,

Ellena was as truly a priſoner as before. 
It appeared then, that the nun had omit- 

ted to faſten the cell only for the pur. 

poſe of allowing her the convenience of 
walking in the paſſage, and ſhe was grate- 
ful for the attention. Still more ſhe was 
fo, when, having traverſed it, ſhe per- 
ceived one extremity terminate in a nar- 
row ſtair-caſe, that ed to lead to 
other chambers. 

She aſcended the winding ſteps haſtily, 
and found they led only to a door, open- 
ing into a ſmall room, where nothing 
remarkable appeared, till ſhe approached 
the windows, and beheld thence an hori- 
zon, and a landſcape ſpread below, whoſe 
' grandeur awakened all her heart, The 
conſciouſneſs of her priſon. was loſt, while 


her eyes ranged over the wide and freely- 
ſublime ſcene withopt. She perceived 


that this chamber was within a ſmall tur- 


ret, projecting from an a gle, of the con- 
vent over the walls, and ee, as in 


air, 


( 265. ) 
air, above the vaſt precipices of granite, 
that formed part of the mountain. Theſe 
precipices were broken into cliffs, which, 
in ſome places, impended far above their 
baſe, and, in others, roſe, in nearly-per- 
pendicular lines, to the walls of the mo- 
naſtery, which they ſupported. Ellena, 
with a dreadful pleaſure, looked down 
them, ſhagged as they were with larch, 
and frequently darkened by lines of gi- 
gantic pine bending along the rocky 
ledges, till her eye reſted on the thick 
cheſnut woods that extended over their 
winding baſe, and which, ſoftening to 
the plains, ſeemed to form a gradation 
between the variegated cultivation there, 
and the awful wildneſs of the rocks above. 
Round theſe extenſive plains were tum- 
bled the mountains, of various ſhape and 
attitude, which Ellena had admired on 
her approach to San Stefano; ſome 
ſhaded with foreſts of olive and almond 
trees, but the greater part abandoned to

the flocks, which, in ſummer, feed on 
their aromatic herbage, and, on the ap- 
proach of winter, deſcend to the ſheltered 
plains of the Tavogliere di Puglia. 

On the left opened the dreadtul deſile 
which ſhe had traverſed, and the thunder 
of whoſe waters now murmured at a dil. 
tance. The accumulation of overtopping 
points, which the mountains of this dark 
perſpective exhibited, preſented an image 
of grandeur ſuperior to any thing ſhe had 
ſeen while within the paſs itſelf. 

To Ellena, whoſe mind was capable of 
being highly elevated, or ſweetly ſoothed, 
by ſcenes of nature, the diſcovery of this 
little turret was an important circum- 
ſtance. Hither ſhe could come, and her 
ſoul, refreſhed by the views it afforded, 
would acquire ſtrength to bear her, with 
equanimity, through the perſecutions that 
might await her. Here, gazing upon the 
ſtupendous imagery around her, looking, 
as it were, beyond the awful veil which 
obſcures 


( 267 


obſcuresthe features of the Deity, and con- 
ceals Him from the eyes of his creatures; 
dwelling as with a preſent God in the 
midſt of his ſublime works; with a mind 
thus elevated, how inſignificant would 
appear to her the tranſactions, and the 
ſufferings of this world! How poor, 
too, the boaſted power of man, when 
the fall of a ſingle cliff from theſe 
mountains would with eaſe deſtroy 
thouſands of his race aſſembled on the 
plains below ! How would it avail them, 
that they were accoutred for battle, arm- 
KF &lt;4 with all the inſtruments of deſtruction 
. WW that human invention ever faſhioned ? 


Thus man, the giant who now held her 
r W in captivity, would ſhrink to the diminu- 
„ tiveneſs of a fairy; and ſhe would expe- 
nh rience, that his utmoſt force was unable 
t to cnchain her ſoul, or compel her to 
je fcar him, while he was deſtitute of 
w virtue.

( 268 ) 


Ellena's attention was recalled from 
the ſcene without by a ſound from the 
gallery below, and ſhe then heard a key 
turning in the door of the paſſage. Fear- 
ing that it was ſiſter Margaritone who 
approached, and who, informed by her 
abſence of the conlolatory turret ſhe had 
diſcovered, would perhaps debar her 
from ever returning to it, Ellena de- 
ſcended with a palpitating heart, and 
found that nun 1n the cell. Surpriſe and 
ſeverity were on her countenance, when 
ſhe enquired by what means Ellena had 
uncloſed the door, and whither ſhe had 
been. | 

Ellena anſwered without any prevari- 
cation, that ſhe had found the door un- 
faſtened, and that ſhe had viſited the tur- 
ret above; but ſhe forbore to expreſs a 
wiſh to return thither, judging that ſuch 
an expreſſion would certainly exclude her 
in future. Margaritone, after ſharply 

rebuking

rebuking her for prying beyond tlie paſl. 
age, and having ſet down the breakfaſt 
ſhe had brought, left the room, the door 
of which ſhe did not forget to ſecure. 
Thus Ellena was at once deprived of fo 
innocent a means of conſolation as her 
pleaſant turret had promiſed. 

During ſeveral days, ſhe ſaw only the 
auſtere nun, except when ſhe attended 
veſpers; where, however, ſhe was fo vi- 
gilantly obſerved, that ſhe feared to ſpeak 
with Olivia, even by her eyes. Olivia's 
were often fixed upon her face, and with 
a kind of expreſſion which Ellena, when 
ſhe did venture to look at her, could not 
perfectly interpret. It was not only of 
pity, but of anxious curioſity, and of 
ſomething allo like fear. A bluſh would 
ſometimes wander over her cheek, which 
was ſucceeded by an extreme palenels, 
and by an air of ſuch univerſal languor 
as precedes a fainting fit : but the exer- 


ciſes of devotion ſeemed frequently to re-

cal her flecting ſpirits, and to elevate 
them with hope and courage. 

When ſhe left the chapel, Ellena faw 
Olivia no more that night; but on the 
following morning ſhe came with break- 
faſt to the cell. A character of peculiar 
ſadneſs was on her brow. 

«* O! how glad Iam to ſee you!“ ſaid 
Ellena ; “and how much I have regret- 
ted your long abſence! I was obliged to 
remember conſtantly what you had en- 
joined, to forbear enquiring after you.” 

The nun replied with a melancholy 
ſmile. © I come in obedience to our lady 
abbeſs,” ſaid ſhe, as ſhe ſeated herſelf on 
Ellena's mattreſs. 

And did you not wiſh to come?“ 
ſaid Ellena, mournfully. 

«I did wiſh it,“ replied Olivia; “ but”? 
 —and ſhe heſitated. 

«© Whence then this reluctance?“ en- 
quired Ellena. 


Olivia was ſilent a moment. 
e You 


1 


« You are a meſſenger of evil news!“ 
ſaid Ellena; “ you are only reluctant to 
afflict me.“ 

It is as you ſay,“ rejoined the nun; 
« am only reluctant to afflict you; and 
fear you have too many attachments to 
the world, to allow you to receive, wich- 
out ſorrow, what I have to communicate. 
I am ordered to prepare you for the 
vows, and to ſay, that, ſince you have 
rejected the huſband which was propoſed 
to you, you are to accept the veil ; that 
many of the cuſtomary forms are to be 
diſpenſed with; and that the ceremony 
of taking the black veil, will follow with- 
out delay that of receiving the white one.” 

The nun pauſed; and Ellena ſaid, 
„ You are an unwilling bearer of this 
cruel meſſage; and I reply only to the 
lady abbeſs, when I declare, that I never 
will accept either ; that force may ſend 
me to the altar, but that it never ſhall 
compel me to utter vows which my heart 


M 4 abhors ; 


5 


„ 


abhors; and if I am conſtrained to ap- 
pear there, it ſhall be only to proteſt 
againſt her tyranny, and againſt the form 
intended to ſanction it.“ 

To Olivia this anſwer was ſo far from 
being diſpleaſing, that it appeared to give 
her ſatis faction. 

I dare not applaud your reſolution,” 
ſaid ſhe; „but I will not condemn it. 
You have, no doubt, connections in the 
world which would render a ſecluſion 
from it afflicting. You have relations, 
friends, from whom it would be dread- 
ful to part?“ 

I have neither, ſaid Ellena, figh- 


ng. 
* No! Can that be poſſible? and yet 
you are ſo unwilling to retire!“ 

„ have only one friend,“ rephed El. 
lena, and it is of him they would de- 
prive me!“ 

Pardon, my love, the abruptneſs ol 
theſe enquiries,“ ſaid Olivia; * yet, 

while 


( 


while I entreat your forgiveneſs, I am in- 
clined to offend again, and to aſk your 
name.” 

That is a queſtion I will readily an- 
ſwer. My name is Ellena di Roſalba.“ 

% How?“ ſaid the nun, with an air of 
deliberation ; © Ellena di“ 

« Di Roſalba, repeated her compa- 
nion : © And permit me to aſk your mo- 
tive for the enquiry: do you know any 
perſon of my name?“ 

„No,“ replied the ſiſter, mournfully 
bat your features have ſome reſem- 
blance to thoſe of a friend I once had.“ 

As ſhe ſpoke this, her agitation was 
apparent, and ſhe roſe to go. ] muſt 
not lengthen my viſit, leſt I ſhould be 
forbidden to repeat it, ſaid ſne. What 
anſwer ſhall I give to the abbeſs? If you 
are determined to reject the veil, allow 
me to adviſe you to ſoften your retuſal as 
much as poſſible. I am, perhaps, better 
acquainted with her character than you

you pining away your exiſtence in this ſo- 
litary cell.” 

„How much I am obliged by the in. 
tereſt you expreſs for my welfare,” ſaid 
Ellena, and by the advice you offer! 
I will yield my judgment in this inſtance 
to your's; you ſhall modulate my re- 
fuſal as you think proper : but remember 
that it muſt be abſolute; and beware, 
leſt the abbeſs ſhould miſtake gentleneſs 
for irreſolution.“ 

&amp; Truſt me, I will be cautious in all 
that relates to you,” ſaid Olivia. Fare- 
well! I will viſit you, if poſſible, in the 
evening. In the mean time the door 
ſhall be left open, that you may have 
more air and proſpect than this cell at- 
fords. That ſtaircaſe leads to a pleaſant 
chamber.“ 

I have viſited it already,” replied 
Ellena, „and have to thank you for the 
goodneſs which permitted me to do ſo.

To go thither will greatly ſoothe my ſpi-

an affectionate ſmile. © Adieu! I will 
endeavour to ſee you in the evening, If 
ſiſter Margaritone returns, be careful not 
to enquire for me; nor once aſk her for 
the little indulgence I give you.“ 

Olivia withdrew, and Ellena retired to 
the chamber above, where ſhe loſt for a 
while all ſenſe of forrow amidlt the great 
ſcenery, which its windows exhibited. 

At noon, the ſtep of Margaritone ſum- 
moned Ellena from her retreat, and ſhe 
was ſurpriſed that no reproof followed 
this ſecond diſcovery of her abſence. 
Margaritone only ſaid, that the abbeſs 
had the goodneſs to permit Ellena to 
dine with the novices, and that ſhe came 
to conduct her to their table.

Ellena did not rejoice in this permiſ- 
ſion, preferring to remain in her ſolitary 
turret, to the being expoſed to the ex- 
amining eyes of ſtrangers ; and ſhe fol. 
lowed dejectedly, through the filent paſſ- 
ages to the apartment where they were 
aſſembled. Here ſhe was not leſs ſurpriſed 
than embarraſſed to obſerve, in the man- 
ners of young people reſiding in a con- 
vent, an abſence of that decorum, which 
includes beneath its modeſt ſhade every 
grace that ought to adorn the female cha- 
racter, like the veil which gives dignity 
to their air and ſoftneſs to their features. 
When Ellena entered the room, the eyes 
of the whole company were immediately 
fixed upon her; the young ladies began 
to whiſper and ſmile, and ſhewed, by va- 
rious means, that ſhe was the ſubject of 
converſation, not otherwiſe than cenſo- 
rious. No one advanced to meet and to 
encourage her, to welcome her to the 

| table, 


„ 


table, or diſplayed one of thoſe name- 
leſs graces, with which a generous and 
delicate mind delights to reanimate the 
modeſt and the unfortunate. 

Ellena took a chair in filence ; and, 
though ſhe had at firſt felt forlorn and 
embarraſſed by the impertinent manners 
of her companions, a conſciouſneſs of in- 
nocence gradually revived her ſpirits, and 
enabled her to reſume an air of dignity, 
which repreſſed this rude preſumption. 

Ellena returned to her cell, for the firſt 
time, with eagerneſs. Margaritone &lt;d 
not faſten the door of it, but ſhe was 
careful to ſecure that of the paſſage; and 
even this ſmall indulgence ſhe ſeemed to 
allow with a ſurly reluQtance, as if com- 
pelled to obey the command of a ſupe- 
riot: The moment ſhe was gone, Ellena 
withdrew to her pleaſant turret, where, 
after having ſuffered from the coarſe 
manners of the novices, her gratitude 
was the more lively, when ſhe perceived 

the 


( 278 ) 

the delicate attention of her beloved nun. 
It appeared that ſhe had viſited the cham. 
ber in Ellena's abſence, and had cauſed 
to be brought thither a chair and a table, 
on which were placed ſome books, and a 
knot of fragrant flowers. Ellena did not 
repreſs the grateful tears, which the gene- 
rous feelings of Olivia excited; and ſhe 
forbore, for ſome moments, to examine 
the books, that the pleaſing emotions ſhe 
experienced might not be interrupted. 

On looking into theſe books, however, 
ſhe perceived, that ſome of them treated 
of myſtical ſubjects, which ſhe laid aſide 
with diſappointment ; but in others ſhe 
obſerved a few of the beſt Italian poets, 
and a volume or two of Guicciardini's 
hiſtory. She was ſomewhat ſurpriſed, 
that the poets ſhould have found their 
way to the library of a nun, but was too 
much pleaſed with the diſcovery to dwell 
on the enquiry.

Having arranged her books, and ſet 
her little room in order, ſhe feated her- 
ſelf at a window, and, with a volume of 
Taſſo, endeavoured to baniſh every pain- 
ful remembrance from her mind. She 
continued wandering in the imaginary 
ſcenes of the poet, till the fading light 
recalled her to thoſe of reality. The 
ſun was ſet, but the mountain-tops were 
ſtill lighted up by his beams, and a tint 
of glorious purple coloured all the welt, 
and began to change the ſnowy points on 
the horizon, The filence and repoſe of 
the vaſt ſcene, promoted the tender me- 
lancholy that prevailed in her heart ; ſhe 
thought of Vivaldi, and wept—of Vival- 


di, whom ſhe might, perhaps, never ſee 
again, though the doubted not that he 


would be indefatigable in ſearching for 
her. Every particular of their laſt con- 
verſation, when he had ſo earneſtly la- 
mented the approaching ſeparation, even 
while he allowed of its propriety, came

to her mind; and, while ſhe witneſſed, 
in imagination, the grief and diſtraction, 
which her myſterious departure and ab- 
ſence muſt have occaſioned him, the for- 
titude, with which ſhe had reſiſted her 
own ſufferings, yielded to the picture of 
his. 

The veſper-bell, at length, ſummoned 
her to prepare for maſs, and ſhe deſcend- 
ed to her cell to await the arrival of her 
conductreſs. It was Margaritone, who 
ſoon appeared ; but in the chapel ſhe, as 
uſual, ſaw Olivia, who, when the ſervice 
had concluded, invited her into the gar- 
den of the convent. There, as ſhe paſſed 
beneath the melancholy cedars, that, 
ranged on either ſide the long walks, 
formed a majeſtic canopy, almoſt exclud- 
ing the evening twilight, Olivia converſ- 
ed with her on ſerious, but general, to- 
pics, carefully avoiding any mention of 
the abbeſs, and of the affairs of Ellena. 
The latter, anxious to learn the effect of 

4 er 


E 


her repeated rejection of the veil, ven- 
tured to make ſome enquiries, which 
the nun immediately diſcouraged, and as 
cautiouſly checked the grateful effuſions 
of her young friend for the attentions ſhe 
had received. | 

Olivia accompanied Ellena to her cell, 
and there no longer ſcrupled to relieve 
her from uncertainty. With a mixture 
ot frankneſs and diſcretion, ſhe related 
as much of the converſation, that had 
paſſed between herſelf and the abbeſs, as 
it ſeemed neceſſary for Ellena to know, 
from which it appeared that the former 
was as obſtinate, as the latter was firm. 

«© Whatever may be your reſolution,”* 
added the nun, I earneſtly adviſe you, 
my ſiſter, to allow the Superior ſome 
hope of compliance, leſt the proceed to 
extremities.” 

And what extremity can be more 
terrible,” replied Ellena, © than either

diſimulation ?”? 

« To ſave yourſelf from undeſerved 
ſufferings,” ſaid Olivia, mournfully. 

&amp;« Yes, but I ſhould then incur deſerv- 
ed ones, obſerved Ellena; “ and for- 
feit ſuch peace of mind as my oppreſſors 
never could reſtore to me.” As ſhe ſaid 
this, ſhe looked at the nun with an ex- 
preſſion of gentle reproach and diſap- 
pointment.

ment,” replied Olivia, regarding her 
with tendereſt compaſſion. * Alas! that 
a mind ſo ingenuous ſhould be ſubjected 
to the power of injuſtice and depravity !” 

Not ſubjected,” ſaid Ellena, with a 
noble pride, do not ſay ſubjected. I have 
accuſtomed myſelf to contemplate thoſe 
ſufferings; I have choſen the leaſt of ſuch 
as were given to my choice, and I will 

endure 


( 283 ) | 
endure them with fortitude; and can you 
then ſay that I am ſubjected ?”? 

Alas, my ſiſter ! you know not what 
you promiſe,” rejoined Olivia; © you 
do not comprehend the ſufferings which 
may be preparing for you.” 

As ſhe ſpoke, her eyes filled with tears, 
and ſhe withdrew them from Ellena, who, 
ſurpriſed at the extreme concern on her 
countenance, entreated ſhe would explain 
herſelf. 

J am not certain, myſelf, as to this 
point,” added Olivia; © and if I were, 
J ſhould not dare to explain it.“ 

Not dare !” repeated Ellena, mourn- 
fully. „Can benevolence like your's 
know fear, when courage is neceſſary to 
prevent evil?“ 

« Enquire no further!“ ſaid the nun; 
but no bluſh of conſcious duplicity ſtain- 
ed her cheek. © It is ſufficĩent that you

ſent to avoid it.“ 

* But how avoid it, my beloved friend, 
without incurring a conſequence which, 
in my apprehenſion, would be yet more 
dreadful ? How avoid it, without either 
ſubjecting myſelf to a hateful marriage, 
or accepting the vows ? Either of theſe 
events would be more terrible to me, 
than any thing with which I may other- 
wiſe be menaced.“ 

„Perhaps not, obſerved the nun. Ima- 
gination cannot draw the horrors of 
But, my fiſter, let me repeat, that I would 
ſave you! O, how willingly ſave you 
from the evils preparing! and that the 
only chance of doing ſo is, by prevailing 
with you to abandon at leaſt the appear- 
ance of reſiſtance,” 

„ Your kindneſs deeply affects me,“ 
ſaid Ellena; and I am fearful of ap- 
pearing inſenſible of it, when I reject your 


advice; 


( 235 ) 


advice; yet I cannot adopt it. The very 
diſſimulation, which I ſhould employ in 
ſelf-detence, might be a means of involv- 
ing me in deſtruction.“ 

As Ellena concluded, and her eyes 
glanced upon the nun, unaccountable 
ſuſpicion occurred to her, that Olivia 
might be inſincere, and that, at this very 
moment, when ſhe was adviſing diſſi- 
mulation, ſhe was endeavouring to draw 
Ellena into ſome ſnare, which the abbeſs 
had laid. She ſickened at this dreadful 
ſuppoſition, and diſmiſſed it without ſuf- 
fering herſelf to examine its probability. 
That Olivia, from whom ſhe had receiv- 
ed ſo many attentions, whoſe counte- 
nance and manners announced ſo fair a 
mind, and for whom ſhe had conceived 
ſo much eſteem and affection, ſhould be 
cruel and treacherous, was a ſuſpicion 
that gave her more pain than the actual 
impriſonment in which ſhe ſuffered ; and 
when ſhe looked again upon her face,

Ellena was conſoled by a clear convic- 
tion, that ſhe was utterly incapable of 
perfidy. 

If it were poſſible that I could con- 
ſent to practiſe deceit,” reſumed Ellena, 
after a long pauſe, © what could it avail 
me? I am entirely in the power of the 
abbeſs, who would ſoon put my ſincerity 
to the proof ; when a diſcovery of my 
duplicity would only provoke her ven- 
geance, and I ſhould be puniſhed even tor 
having ſought to avoid injuſtice.” 

If deceit is at any time excuſable, 
replied Olivia, reluctantly, © it is when 
we practiſe it in ſelf- defence. There are 
ſome rare ſituations, when it may be re- 
ſorted to without our incurring ignonü— 
ny, and your's is one of thoſe. But! 
will acknowledge, that all the good I ex- 
pect is from the delay which temporizing 
may procure you. The Superior, when 
ſhe underſtands there is a probability of 
"obtaining your conſent to her wiſhes,

may be willing to allow you the ufual 
time of preparation for the veil, and 
meanwhile ſomething may occur to 
reicue you from your preſent ſituation.” 

*© Ah! could I but believe ſo!” ſaid 
Ellena ; © but, alas! what power can reſ- 
cue nie? And J have not one relative re- 
maining even to attempt my deliverance. 
To what poſhbility do you allude?“ 

The Marcheſa may relent.“ 

* Does, then, your poſſibility of good 
reſt with her, my dear friend? It fo, I 
am in deſpair again; for ſuch a chance 
of beneſit, there would certainly be little 
policy in forfeiting one's integrity.“ 

* 'There are alſo other poſſibilities, my 
ſiſter,“ ſaid Olivia; © but hark! what 
bell is that? It is the chime which aſ- 
ſembles the nuns in the apartment of the 
abbeſs, where ſhe diſpenſes her evening 
benediction. My abſence will be ob- 
ſerved. Good night, my ſiſter. Reflect 
on what I have adviſed ; and remember, 

] conjure 


( 288 )) 


I conjure you, to conſider, that the con- 
ſequence of your deciſion muſt be ſolemn, 
and may be fatal.” 

The nun ſpoke this with a look and 
emphaſis ſo extraordinary, that Ellena at 
once wiſhed and dreaded to know more; 
but before ſhe had recovered from her 
ſurpriſe, Olivia had left the room.

MysTERrtous Mor. 


Tus adventurous Vivaldi, and his ſer- 
vant Paulo, after paſſing the night of El- 
lena's' departure from villa Altieri in one 
of the ſubterraneous chambers of the fort 
of Paluzzi, and yielding, at length, to 
exhauſted nature, awoke in terror and 
utter darkneſs, for the flambean had ex- 
pired. When a recollection of the oc- 
currences of the preceding evening re- 
turned, they renewed their efforts for 
liberty with ardour. The grated win- 
dow was again examined, and being 
found to overlook only a confined court 
of the fortreſs, no hope appeared of 
eſcaping. 

VOL. I. N The

The words of the monk returned with 
Vivaldi's firſt recollections, to torture 
him with apprehenſion, that Ellena was 
no more; and Paulo, unable either to 
conſole or to appeaſe his maſter, ſat 
down dejectedly beſide him. Paulo had 
no longer a hope to ſuggeſt, or a joke to 
throw away; and he could not forbear 
ſeriouſly remarking, that to die of hun- 
ger was one of the moſt horrible means 
of death, or lamenting the rafhneſs which 
had made them liable to ſo fad a proba- 
bility. . 
He was in the midſt of a very pathetic 
oration, of which, however, his 'maſter 
did not hear a ſingle word, fo wholly 
was his attention engaged by his own 
melancholy thoughts, when on a ſudden 
he became ſilent, and then, ſtarting to 
his feet, exclaimed, © Signor, what is 
yonder? Do you ſee nothing!“ 
Vivaldi looked round. 


cc It 


(-- 298) 


It is certainly a ray of light,“ conti- 
nued Paulo; “ and I will ſoon know 
where it comes from.“ 

As he ſaid this he ſprung forward, and 
his ſurpriſe almoſt equalled his joy when 
he diſcovered that the light iſſued through 
the door of the vault, which ſtood a little 
open. He could ſcarcely believe his 
ſenſes, ſince the door had been ſtrongly 
faſtened on the preceding night, and he 
had not heard its ponderous bolts un- 
drawn. He threw it widely open, but 
recollecting himſelf, ſtopped to look into 
the adjoining vault before he ventured 
forth; when Vivaldi darted paſt him, 
and bidding him follow inſtantly, aſcend- 
ed to the day. The courts of the fortreſs 
were ſilent and vacant, and Vivaldi 
reached the arch-way without having 
obſerved a ſingle perſon, breathleſs with 
ſpeed, and ſcarcely daring to believe that 
he had regained his liberty, | 


N 2 Beneath 


( 292 ) 

Beneath the arch he ſtopped to recover 
breath, and to conſider whether he ſhould 
take the road to Naples, or to Altieri, for 
it was yet early morning, and at an hour 
when it appeared improbable that Elle- 
na's family would be riſen. The appre- 
henſion of her death had vaniſhed as Vi- 
valdi's ſpirits revived, which this pauſe 
of heſitation ſufficiently announced : but 
even this was the pauſe only of an in- 
ſtant ; a ſtrong anxiety concerning her 
determined him to proceed to Villa 
Altieri, notwithſtanding the unſuitable- 
neſs . of the hour, ſince he could, at 
leaſt, reconnoitre her reſidence, and 
await till ſome ſign of the family having 
ariſen ſhould appear. 

„ Pray, Signor,“ ſaid Paulo, while 
his maſter was deliberating, ** do not 
let us ſtop here leſt the enemy ſhould ap- 
pear again; and do, Signor, take the 
road which is neareſt to ſome houſe 
where we may get breakfaſt, for the 

fear 


(203 --:3 


fear of ſtarving has taken ſuch hold upon 
me, that 1t has _y anticipated the re- 
ality of it already.” 

Vivaldi immediately departed for the 
villa, Paulo, as he danced joytully 
along, expreſſed all the aſtoniſhment 
that filled his mind, as to the cauſe of 


their late impriſonment and eſcape ; but 


Vivaldi, who had now leiſure to conſider 
the ſubject, could not aſſiſt him in ex- 
plaining it. The only certain point was, 
that he had not been confined by rob- 
bers; and what intereſt any perſon could 
have in impriſoning him for the night, 
and ſuffering him to eſcape in the morn- 
ing, did not appear. 

On entering the garden at Altieri, he 
was furpriſed to obſerve that ſeveral of 
the lower lattices were open at this early 
hour, but ſurpriſe changed to terror, 
when, on reaching the portico, he heard 
a moaning of diſtreſs from the hall, and 
when, after loudly calling, he was an-

fwered by the piteous cries of Beatrice. 
The hall door was faſtened, and, Bea- 
trice being unable to open it, Vivaldi, 
tolowed by Paulo, ſprang through one 
of the uncloſed lattices ; when on reach- 
ing the hall, he found the houſekeeper 
bound to a pillar, and learned that El- 
lena had been carried off ang the 
night by armed men. 

For a moment he was almoſt ſtupified 
by the ſhock of this intelligence, and then 
aſked Beatrice a thouſand queſtions con- 
cerning the affair, without allowing her 
time to anſwer one of them. When, 
however, he had patience to liſten, he 
learned that the ruffians were four in 
number; that they were maſked ; that 
two of them had carried Ellena through 
the garden, while the others, after bind- 
ing Beatrice to a pillar, threatening her 
with death it ſhe made any noife, and 
watching over her till their comrades 


had fecured their prize, left her a pri 
ſoner.

ſoner. This was all the information ſhe 
could give reſpecting Ellena. 

Vivaldi, when he could think coolly, 
believed he had diſcovered the inſtigators 
and the deſign of the whole affair, and 
the cauſe, alſo, of his late confinement. 
It appeared that Ellena had been carried 
off by order of his family, to prevent 
the intended marriage, and that he had 
been decoyed into the fort of Paluzzi, 
and kept a priſoner there, to ſecure him 
from interrupting the ſcheme, which his 
preſence at the villa would effectually 
have done. He had himfelf ſpoken of 
his former adventure at Paluzzi; and it 
was now evident that his family had taken 
advantage of the curioſity he had expreſſ- 
ed, to lead him into the vaults. The 
event of this deſign had been the more 
probable, ſince, as the fort lay in the di- 
rect road to Altieri, Vivaldi could not go 
thither without being obſerved by the 
creatures of the Marcheſa, who, by an 

N 4 artful 


( 296 |) 


_ artful manceuvre; might make him their 
priſoner, without employing violence. 
As he conſidered theſe circumſtances, 
it appeared almoſt certain, that father 
Schedoni was in truth the monk who had 
fo long haunted his ſteps; that he was 
the {ſecret adviſer of his mother, and one 
of the authors of the predicted misfor- 
tunes, which, it ſeemed, he poſſeſſed a 
too infallible means of fulfilling. Yet 
Vivaldi, while he admitted the proba- 
bility of all this, reflected with new aſto- 
niſhment on the conduct of Schedoni, 
during his interview with him in the 
Marcheſa's cabinet; — the air of dignified 
innocence, with which he had repreſſed 
accuſation, the apparent ſimplicity, with 
which he had pointed out circumſtances 
reſpecting the ſtranger, that ſeemed to 
make againſt himſelf; and Vivaldi's opi- 
nion of the confeſſor's duplicity began to 
» waver. * Yet what other perſon,” ſaid 
he, “could be ſo intimately acquainted 


with

with my concerns, or have an intereſt 
ſufficiently ſtrong for thus indefatigably 
thwarting me, except this confeſſor, who 
is, no doubt, well rewarded for his per- 
leverance ? The monk can be no other 
than Schedoni; yet it is ſtrange that he 
ſhould have forborn to diſguiſe his per- 
ſon, and ſhould appear in this myſterious 
office in the very habit he uſually 
wears!“ 

Whatever might be the truth as to 
Schedoni, it was evident that Ellena had 
been carried away by order of Vivaldi's 
family, and he immediately returned to- 
wards Naples with an intention of de- 
manding her at their hands, not with 
any hope of their compliance, but be- 
heving that they might accidentally 
afford him ſome lights on the ſub- 
ject. If, however, he ſhould fail to 
obtain any hint that might aſſiſt him in 
tracing the route ſhe had been carried, 


he determined to viſit Schedoni, accuſe

planation of his conduct, and, if poſlible, 
obtain from him a knowledge of Ellena's 
place of confinement. 

When, at length, he obtained an in- 
terview with the Marcheſe, and, throw- 
ing himſelf at his feet, ſupplicated that 
Ellena might be reſtored to her home, 
the unaffected ſurpriſe of his father over- 
wWhelmed him with aſtoniſhment and de- 
ſpair. The look and manner of the 
Marcheſe could not be doubted; Vivaldi 
was convinced that he was abſolutely ig-

However ungraciouſly you have con-

to prevent ſuch a meaſure, than by tell- 
ing you the conſequence” you are to ex- 
pect; from thenceforth I will diſown 
you for my ſon.” 

The Marcheſe quitted the apartment 
when he had ſaid this, and Vivaldi made 
no attempt to detain him. His words 
expreſſed little more than they had for- 
merly done, yet Vivaldi was ſhocked by 


the abſolute menace now delivered. The 


ſtronger paſſion of his heart, however, 
ſoon overcame their effect; and this 
moment, when he began to fear that he 
had irrecoverably loſt the object of his 
deareſt affections, was not the time, in 
which he could long feel remoter evils, 
or calculate the force of misfortunes 
which never might arrive. The nearer 


intereſt preſſed ſolely upon his mind, and 


he was conſcious only' to the loſs of 
Ellena. .

The interview, which followed with 
his mother, was of a different charac. 
ter from that which had occurred with 
the Marcheſe, The keen dart of ſuſpi- 
cion, however, ſharpened as it was by 
love and by deſpair, pierced beyond the 
veil of her duplicity; and Vivaldi as 
quickly detected her hypocriſy as he 
had yielded his conviction to the ſincerity 
of the Marcheſe. But his power reſted 
here; he poſſeſſed no means of awaken- 
ing her pity or actuating her juſtice, and 
could not obtain even a hint that might 
guide him in his ſearch of Ellena. 
Schedoni yet remained to be tried ; 
Vivaldi had no longer a doubt as to his 
having caballed with the Marcheſa, and 
that he had been an agent in removing 
Ellena. Whether, however, he was the 
perſon who haunted the ruins of Pa- 
luzzi, was {till queſtionable ; for, though 
» Teveral circumſtances ſeemed to declare 
in 


(988: -) 
in the affirmative, others, not leſs plau- 
ſible, aſſerted the contrary. 

On leaving the Marcheſa's apartment, 
Vivaldi repaired to the convent of the 
Spirito Santo, and enquired for father 
Schedoni. The lay- brother who opened 
the gate, informed him that the father 
was in his cell, and Vivaldi ſtepped im- 
patiently into the court requeſting to be 
ſhewn thither. 

„I dare not leave the gate, Signor,“ 
ſaid the brother, but if you croſs the 
court, and aſcend that ſtaircaſe which 
you fee yonder beyond the doorway on 
your right, it will lead you to a gallery, 
and the third door you will come to is 
father Schedoni's.“ 

Vivaldi paſſed on without Saag an- 
other human being, and not a ſound 
diſturbed the filence of this ſanctuary, 
till, as he aſcended the ſtairs, a feeble 
note of lamentation proceeded from the 

gallery,

by ſome penitent at confeſſion. 
He ſtopped, as he had been directed, 
at the third door, when, as he gently 
knocked, the ſound ceaſed, and the ſame 
profound filence returned. Vivaldi re- 
peated his ſummons, but, receiving no 
anſwer, he ventured to open the door. 
In the duſky cell within no perſon ap- 
peared, but he ſtill looked round, ex- 
petting to diſcover ſome. one in the du- 
bious gloom. The chamber contained 
little more than a mattreſs, a chair, a 
table, and a crucifix; ſome books of 
devotion were upon the table, one 'or 
two of which were'written in unknown 
characters; ſeveral inſtruments of tor- 
ture lay beſide them. Vivaldi ſhuddered 
as he haſtily examined thefe, though he 
did not comprehend the manner of their 
apphcation, and he left the chamber, 
without noticing any other obje&amp;, and

returned to the court. The porter ſaid, 
that ſince father Schedoni was not in his 
cell, he was probably either in the church 
or in the gardens, for that he had not 
paſſed the gates during the morning. 

“Did he paſs yeſter- evening!“ ſaid 
Vivaldi, eagerly. | 

“ Yes, he returned to veſpers,“ re- 
plied the brother with ſurpriſe. 

* Are you certain as to that, my 
friend?“ rejoined Vivaldi; “ are you 
certain that he ſlept in the convent laſt 
night?“ 

* Who is it that aſks the queſtion?“ 
ſaid the lay-brother, with diſpleaſure ; 
and what right has he to make it? 
You are ignorant of the rules of our 
houſe, Signor, or you would perceive 
ſuch queſtions to be unneceſſary; any 
member of our community is liable to 
be ſeverely puniſhed if he ſteep a night 
without theſe walls, and father Schedoni 


would be the laſt among us ſo to treſpaſs.

imitate his ſevere example. His volun-

He paſs the night abroad ! Go, Signor, 
yonder 1s the church, you will find him 
there, perhaps.” 

Vivaldi did not linger to reply. © The

ed to the church, which formed one fide 
of the quadrangle ; © but I will unmaſk 
him.“ 

The church, which he entered, was va- 
cant and ſilent like the court. Whi- 
ther can the inhabitants of this place 
have withdrawn themſelves?““ ſaid he; 
* wherever I go, I hear only the echoes 
of my own footſteps ; it ſeems as if death 
reigned here over all ! But, perhaps, it 
is one of the hours of general meditation, 
and the monks have only retired to their 
cells.”

As he paced the long aiſles, he ſud- 
denly ſtopped to catch the ſtartling 
ſound that murmured through the lofty 
roof; but it ſeemed to be only the cloſ- 
ing of a diſtant door. Yet he often 
looked forward into the ſacred gloom, 
which the painted windows threw over 
the remote perſpective, in the expectation 
of perceiving a monk. He was not long 
diſappointed; a perſon appeared, ſtand- 
ing ſilently in an obſcure part of the 
cloiſter, cloathed in the habit of this ſo- 
ciety, and he advanced towards him. 

The monk did not avoid Vivaldi, or 
even turn to oblerve who was approach- 
ing, but remained in the ſame attitude, 
fixed like a ſtatue. This tall and gaunt 
figure had, at a diſtance, reminded him 
of Schedoni, and Vivaldi, as he now 
looked under the cowl, diſcovered the 
ghaſtly countenance of the confeſſor. 

Have I found you at laſt?“ ſaid Vi- 
valdi, I would ſpeak with you, father, 

in

in private. This is not a proper place 
for ſuch diſcourſe as we muſt hold.“ 

Schedoni made no reply, and Vivaldi, 
once again looking at him, obſerved that 
his features were fixed, and his eyes bent 
towards the ground. The words of Vi- 
valdi ſeemed not to have reached his un- 
derſtanding, nor even to have made any 
impreſſion on his ſenſes. 

He repeated them in a louder tone, 
but {till not a ſingle line of Schedoni's 
countenance acknowledged their influ- 
ence. © What means this mummery ?” 
ſaid he, his patience exhauſted,” and his 
indignation arouſed ; * This wretched 
ſubterfuge ſhall not protect you, you are 
detected, your ſtratagems are known! 
Reſtore Ellena di Roſalba to her home, 
or confeſs where Jou have concealed 
her.“ 

Schedoni was ſtill ſilent and unmoved. 
A reſpect for his age and profeſſion with- 
held Vivaldi from ſeizing and compelling 

him 


(97 53 


him to anſwer ; but the agony of impa- 
tience and indignation which he ſuffered, 
formed a ſtriking contraſt to the death- 
like apathy of the monk. I now alſo 
know you,“ continued Vivaldi, “ for my 
tormentor at Paluzzi, the prophet of 
evils, which you too well practiſed the 
means of fulfilling, the prediQor of the 
death of Signora Bianchi.“ Schedoni 
frowned. The forewarner of Ellena's 
departure; the phantom who decoyed 
me into the dungeons of Paluzzi; the 
prophet and the ee of all my miſ- 
fortunes.“ 

The monk raiſed his eyes from the 
ground, and fixed them with terrible 
expreſſion upon Vivaldi, but was ſtill 
ſilent. 

„Ves, father, added Vivaldi, I 
know and will proclaim you to the 
world. I will ſtrip you of the holy hy- 
pocriſy in which N ſhroud yourſelf; 

announce 


N 
announce to all your ſociety the deſpi. 
cable artifices you have employed, and 
the miſery you have occaſioned. Your 
character ſhall be announced aloud.” 

While Vivaldi ſpoke, the monk had 
withdrawn his eyes, and fixed them again 
on the ground. His countenance had re- 
ſumed its uſual expreſſion. 

«© Wretch ! reſtore to me Ellena di 
Rofalba !”* cried Vivaldi, with the ſudden 
anguiſh of renewed deſpair. “ Tell me 
at leaſt, where ſhe may be found, or yog 
ſhall be compelled to do ſo. Whither, 
whither have you conveyed her?“ 

As he pronounced this in loud and 
paſſionate accents, ſeveral eccleſiaſtics 
entered the cloiſters, and were paſſing on 
to the body of the church, when his voice 
| arreſted their attention. They pauſed, 
and perceiving the ſingular attitude of 
Schedoni, and the frantic geſticulations 
of Vivaldi, haſtily advanced towards 

them.

ſtrangers, as he ſeized the cloak of Vival- 
di, “do you not obſerve !”? 

J obſerve a hypocrite,” replied Vi- 
valdi, ſtepping back and diſengaging 
himfelf, © I obſerve a deſtroyer of the 
peace, it was his duty to protect. TI” 


„ Forbear this deſperate conduct,“ 
ſaid the prieſt, © leſt it provoke the 
juſt vengeance of Heaven! Do you not 
obſerve alſo the holy office in which he is 
engaged?“ pointing to the monk. Leave 
the church while you are permitted to 
| do ſo in ſafety ; you ſuſpect not the pu- 
mſhment you may provoke.” 

« I will not quit the ſpot till you an- 
ſwer my enquiries,” ſaid Vivaldi to Sche- 
doni, without deigning even to look up- 
on the prieſt ; Where, I repeat, is El- 
lena di Roſalba?“ : 
Ihe confeffor was till ſilent and un-

and all belief,“ continued Vivaldi.

Vivaldi thought he perceiyed the coun- 
tenance of the monk ſuffer ſome change. 
«© Do you remember that terrible night,” 
he added, when on the ſteps of that 
confeſſional, a tale was told? —— 

Schedoni raiſed his eyes, and fixing 
them once more on Vivaldi, with a look 
that ſeemed intended to ſtrike him to the 
duſt, „ Avaunt!”? cried he in a tre- 
mendous voice; “ avaunt! ſacrilegious 
boy! Tremble for the conſequence of

As he concluded, he ſtarted from hi: 
poſition, and gliding with the filent ſwift- 
neſs of a ſhadow along the cloiſter, va-

tempting to purſue him, was ſeized by

e Away! away!” repeated his compa. 
nions, and they endeavoured to force 
Vivaldi through the cloiſters. But with 
the ſudden ſtrength which pride and in- 
dignation lent him, he burſt from their 
united hold, and, quitting the church by 
another door, eſcaped into the ſtreet. 

Vivaldi returned home in a ſtate of 
mind that would have engaged the pity 
of any heart, which prejudice or ſelt- 
intereſt had not hardened. He avoided 
his father, but ſought the Marcheſa, 
who, however, triumphant in the ſuccels 
of her plan, was ſtill inſenſible to the 
ſufferings of her fon. 

When the Marcheſa had been inform- 
ed of his approaching marriage, ſhe had, 
as uſual, conſulted with her confeſſor on 
the means of preventing it, who had ad- 
viſed the ſcheme ſhe adopted, a ſcheme 
which was the more eaſily carried into 
effect, ſince the Marcheſa had early in 
life been acquainted with the abbeſs of 
San Stefano, and knew, therefore, enou gh

of her character and diſpoſition” to con- 
fide, without heſitation, the management 
of this important affair to her diſcretion. 
The anſwer of the abbeſs to her propoſal, 
was not merely acquieſcent, but zealous, 
and it appeared that ſhe too faithfully 
juſtified the confidence repoſed in her, 
After this plan had been ſo ſucceſsfully 
proſecuted, it was not to be hoped that 
the Marcheſa would be prevailed upon to 
relinquiſh it by the tears, the anguiſh, or 
all the varied ſufferings of her ſon. Vi- 
valdi now reproved the eaſineſs of his 
own confidence in having hoped it, and 
quitted her cabinet with a deſpondency 


that almoſt reached deſpair. 


The faithful Paulo, when he obeyed 
the haſty ſummons of his maſter, had 
not ſucceeded in obtaining intelligence of 
Ellena ; and Vivaldi, having diſmiſſed 
him again on the ſame enquiry, retired to 
his apartment, where the exceſs of grief, 
and a feeble hope of deviſing ſome ſuc-

ceſsful mode of remedy, alternately agi. 
tated and detained him. 

In the evening, reſtleſs and anxious 
for change, though ſcarcely knowing 
whither to bend his courſe, he left the 
palace, and ſtrolled down to the ſea- beach. 
A few fiſhermen and lazzaroni only were 
loitering along the ſtrand, waiting for 
boats from St. Lucia. Vivaldi, with 
folded arms, and his hat drawn over his 
face to ſhade his ſorrow from obſervation, 
paced the edge of the waves, liſtening to 
their murmur, as they broke gently at 
his feet, and gazing upon their undulat- 
ing beauty, while all conſciouſneſs was 
loſt in melancholy reverie concerning 
Ellena. Her late reſidence appeared at 
a diſtance, riſing over the ſhore. He re- 
membered how often from thertce they 
had together viewed this lovely ſcene ! 
Its features had now loſt their charm ; 
they were colourleſs and unintereſting, or 
impreſſed only mournful ideas. The ſea 

fluctuat-

fluctuating beneath the ſetting ſun, the 
long mole and its light-houſe tipped with 
the laſt rays, fiſhermen repoſing in the 
ſhade, little boats ſkimming over the 
fmooth waters, which their oars ſcarcely 
dimpled; theſe were images that 
brought to his recollection the affecting 
evening when he had laſt ſeen this picture 
from Villa Altieri, when, ſeated in the 
orangery with Ellena and Bianchi, on the 
night preceding the death of the latter, 
Ellena herſelf had ſo ſolemnly been given 
to his care, and had ſo afſfectingly con- 
ſented to the dying requeſt of her relative. 
The recollection of that ſcene came to 
Vivaldi with all the force of contraſt, and 
renewed all the anguiſh of deſpair; he 
paced the beach with quicker ſteps, and 
long groans burſt from his heart. He 
accuſed himſelf of indifference and in- 
activity, for having been thus long unable 
to diſcover a ſingle circumſtance which 
might direct his ſearch; and though he

knew not whither to go, he determined 
to leave Naples immediately, and return 


no more to his father's manſion till he 
ſhould have reſcued Ellena. 


Of ſome fiſhermen who were converſ. 
ing together upon the beach, he enquired 
whether they could accommodate him 
with a boat, in which he meant to coaſt 
the bay ; for it appeared probable that 
Ellena had been conveyed from Altieri 
by water, to ſome town or convent on 
the ſhore, the privacy and facility of ſuch 
a mode of conveyance being ſuitable to 


the deſigns of her enemies. 

&amp;« have but one boat, Signor,“ ſaid 
a fiſherman, © and that is buſy enough 
in going to- and fro between here and

you help the Signor to your little (kiff ?

the trade,”

His comrade, however, was too much 
engaged with a party of three or four 
men, who were liſtening in deep atten- 
tion round him, to reply ; Vivaldi ad- 
vancing to urge the queſtion, was ſtruck 
by the eagerneſs with which he delivered 
his narrative, as well as the uncouthneſs 
of his geſticulation; and he pauſed a 
moment in attention. One of the au- 
ditors ſeemed to doubt of ſomething 
that had been aſſerted. © I tell you,” 
replied the narrator, © I uſed to carry fiſh 
there, two and three times a week, and 
very good ſort of people they were; 
they have laid out many a ducat with me 
in their time. But as I was ſaying, when 
I got there, and knocked upon the door, 
I heard, all of a ſudden, a huge groan- 
ing, and preſently I heard the voice of 
the old houſekeeper herſelf, roaring out 
for help ; but I could give her none, for 
the door was faſtened ; and, while I ran

ran to him, comes a Signor, and jumps 
through the window and ſets her at li- 
berty at once. So then, I heard the 
whole ſtory.“ 

„What ſtory ?”” ſaid Vivaldi, “ and of 

whom do you ſpeak ?” 
All in good time, Magſero, you ſhall 
hear, ſaid the fiſherman, who looking 
at him for a moment, added, Why, 
Signor, it ſhould be you I ſaw there, 
you ſhould be the very Signor that let 
old Beatrice looſe.” 

Vivaldi, who had ſcarcely doubted be- 
fore, that it was Altieri of which the 
man had ſpoken, now aſked a thouſand 
queſtions - reſpecting the route the rut- 
fians had taken Ellena, but obtained no 
relief to his anxiety. 

&amp; I ſhould not wonder,” ſaid a Laz- 
Zaro, who had been liſtening to the rela- 
tion, „I ſhould not wonder if the

fame morning, with the blinds drawn up, 
though it was ſo hot that people could 
ſcarcely breathe in the open air, ſhould 
prove to be it which carried oft the 
lady!“ 

This hint was ſufficient to reanimate 
Vivaldi, who collected all the information 
the Lazzaro could give, which was, how- 


ever, little more than that a carriage, 
ſuch as he deſcribed, had been ſeen by 


him, driving furiouſly through Bracelli, 


early on the morning mentioned as that 
of Signora di Roſalba's departure. Vi- 
valdi had now little doubt as to its being 
the one which conveyed her away, and 
he determined to ſet out immediately for 
that place, where he hoped to obtain 
from the poſt-maſter further intelligence 

concerning the road ſhe had purſued. 
With this intention he returned once 
more to his father's manſion, not to

his ſervant Paulo, who he meant ſhould

ſpirits were now animated with hope, 
ſlender as were the circumftances that 
ſupported it; and, believing his deſign 
to be wholly unſuſpected by thoſe who 
would be diſpoſed to interrupt it, he did 
not guard either againſt the meaſures, 
which might impede his departure from 


Naples, or thoſe which might overtake 
him on his journey.

What, would'ſt thou have a ſerpent ſting thee

Tur Marcheſa, alarmed at ſome hints 
dropped by Vivaldi in the late interview 
between them, and by ſome circumſtances 
of his latter conduct, ſummoned her con- 
ſtant adviſer, Schedoni. Still ſuffering 
with the inſult he had received in the 
church of the Spirito Santo, he obeyed 
with ſullen reluctance, yet not without a 
malicious hope of diſcovering ſome oppor- 
tunity for retaliation. That inſult, which 
had pointed forth his hypocriſy, and ridi- 
culed the ſolemn abſtraction he aſſumed, 
had ſunk deep in his heart, and, fer- 
menting the direſt paſſions of his nature, 
he meditated a terrible revenge. It had 
ſubjected him to mortifications of various

kinds. Ambition, it has already appear- 
ed, was one of his ſtrongeſt motives of 
action, and he had long ſince aſſumed a 
character of ſevere ſanctity, chiefly for the 
purpoſes of lifting him to promotion. He 
was not beloved in the ſociety of which 
he was a member ; and many of the bro- 
therhood, who had laboured to diſappoint 
his views, and to detect his errors, who 
hated him for his pride, and envied him 
for his reputed ſanctity, now gloried in 
the mortification he had received, and 
endeavoured to turn the circumſtance to 
their own advantage. They had not 
ſcrupled already to diſplay by infinuation 
and pointed ſneers, their triumph, and to 
menace his reputation ; and Schedoni, 
though he deſerved contempt, was not 
of a temper to endure it. 

But above all, ſome hints reſpecting 
his paſt life, which had fallen from Vi- 
yaldi, and which occaſioned him ſo ab- 


ruptly to leave the church, alarmed him.

(3 3423) 


So much terror, indeed, had they ex- 
cited, that it is not improbable that he 
would have ſealed his ſecret in death, 
devoting Vivaldi to the grave, had he not 
been reſtrained by the dreaded vengeance 
of the Vivaldi family. Since that hour 
he had known no peace, and had never 
ſlept; he had taken ſcarcely any food, 
and was almoſt continually on his knees 
upon the ſteps of the high altar. The 
devotees who beheld him, pauſed and ad- 
mired ; ſuch of the brothers as diſliked 
him, ſmeered and paſſed on. Schedoni 
appeared alike inſenſible to each; loſt to 
this world, and preparing for a higher. 


The torments of his mind and the ſe- 
vere penance he had obſerved, had pro- 
duced a ſurpriſing change in his appear- 
ance, ſo that he reſembled a ſpectre rather 
than a human being. His viſage was wan 
and waſted, his eyes were ſunk and be- 
come nearly motionleſs, and his whole

air and attitudes exhibited the wild energy 
of ſomething—not of this earth. 

When he was ſummoned by the Mar- 
cheſa, his conſcience whiſpered this to be 
the conſequence of circumſtances, which 
Vivaldi had revealed; and, at firſt, he 
had determined not to attend her ; but, 
conſidering that if it was fo, his refuſal 
would confirm ſuſpicion, he reſolved to 
truſt once more to the ſubtilty of his ad- 
dreſs for deliverance. 


With theſe apprehenſions, tempered 
by this hope, he entered the Marcheſa's 
cloſet. She almoſt ſtarted on obſerving 
him, and could not immediately with- 
draw her eyes from his altered viſage, 
while Schedoni was unable wholly to 
conceal the perturbation which ſuch ear- 
neſt obſervation occaſioned. © Peace reſt 
with you, daughter!“ ſaid he, and he 
feated himſelf, without lifting his eyes 
from the floor. 


« I wiſth- 


( 325 ) 
© I wiſhed to ſpeak with you, father, 


upon affairs of moment,“ faid the Mar- 


cheſa gravely, © which are probably not 
unknown to you.” She pauſed, and 
Schedoni bowed his head, awaiting in 
anxious expectation what was to follow. 

&amp; You are filent, father, reſumed 
the Marcheſa. What am I to under. 
ftand by this?“ 

That you have been miſinformed,”? 
replied Schedoni, whoſe apt conſcience 
betrayed his diſcretion. 


&amp; Pardon me,” ſaid the Marcheſa, I 
am too well informed, and ſhould not 
have requeſted your vifit if any doubt 
had remained upon my mind.” 

Signora! be cautious of what you 
credit,” ſaid the confeſſor imprudently ; 


« you know not the conſequence of a 


haſty credulity.” 


Would that mine were a raſh cre- 
dulity !!? replied the Marcheſa; but 


we are betrayed.”

Me?“ repeated the monk, beginning 
to revive : ©* What has happened?“ 

The Marcheſa informed him of Vi- 
valdi's abſence, and inferred from its 
length, for it was now ſeveral days ſince 
his departure, that he had certainly diſ- 
covered the place of Ellena's confine- 
ment, as well as the authors of it. 

Schedoni differed from her, but hint- 
ed, that the obedience of youth was 
hopeleſs, unleſs ſeverer meaſures were 
adopted. 

* Severer !” exclaimed the Marcheſa ; 
good father, is it not ſevere enough to 
confine her for life?“ 

*I mean ſeverer with reſpe&amp; to your 
ſon, lady,“ rephed Schedoni. When 
a. young man has ſo far overcome all 
reverence for an holy ordinance as pub- 
licly to inſult its profeſſors, and yet more, 
when that profeſſor is in the very per- 
formance of his duties, it is time he 
ſhould be controlled with a ſtrong hand. 

I am 


1 


I am not in the practice of adviſing ſuch 
meaſures, but the conduct of Signor Vi- 
valdi is ſuch as calls aloud for them. 
Public decency demands it. For myſelf, 
indeed, I ſhould have endured patiently 
the indignity which has been offered me, 
receiving it as a ſalutary mortification, as 
one of thoſe inflictions that purify the 
ſoul from the pride which even the ho- 
lieſt men may unconſciouſly cheriſh. But 
I am no longer permitted to conſider my- 
ſelf; the public good requires that an 
example ſhould be made of the horrible 
impiety of which your ſon, it grieves 
me, daughter, to diſcloſe it - your ſon, 
unworthy of ſuch a mother ! has been 
guilty.” 

It is evident that in the ſtyle, at leaſt, 
of this accuſation, Schedoni ſuffered the 
force of his reſentment to prevail over the 


uſual ſubtilty of his addreſs, the deep 


and ſmooth inſinuation of his policy.

« To- what do you allude, righteous 
father?“ enquired the aſtoniſhed. Mar- 
cheſa ; „what indignity, what impiety 
has my ſon to anſwer for ? I entreat you 
will fpeak explicitly, that T may prove I 
can loſe the mother in the ſtrict ſeverity 
of the judge.” 

That is ſpoken with the grandeur of 
fentiment, which has always diſtinguiſhed 
you, my daughter! Strong minds per- 
ceive that juſtice is the higheſt of the 
moral attributes, mercy is only the fa- 
vounite of weak ones.“ 

Schedoni had a view in this commend- 
ation beyond that of confirming the Mar- 
cheſa's preſent reſolution againſt Vivaldi. 
He wiſhed to prepare her for meaſures, 
which might hereafter be neceſſary to ac- 
compliſſi the revenge he meditated, and 
he knew that by flattering her vanity, he 
was moſt likely to ſucceed. He praiſed 
her, therefore, for qualities he wiſhed her 

| to 


( 329 ) 


to poſſeſs, encouraged her to reject ge- 
neral opinions by admiring as the ſymp- 
toms of a ſuperior underſtanding, the 
convenient morality upon which ſhe had 
occaſionally acted; and, calling ſternneſs 
juſtice, extolled that for ſtrength of mind, 
which was only callous inſenſibility. 

He then deſcribed to her Vivaldi's late 
conduct in the church of the Spirito Santo, 
exaggerated ſome offenſive circumſtances 
of it, invented others, and formed of the 
whole an inſtance of monſtrous impiety 
and unprovoked inſult. 

The Marcheſa liſtened to the relation 
with no leſs indignation than ſurprize, 
and her readineſs to adopt the confeſſor's 
advice allowed him to depart with reno- 
vated ſpirits and moſt triumphant hopes. 

Meanwhile, the Marcheſe remained 
ignorant of the ſubject of the conference 
with Schedoni. His opinions had for- 
merly been ſounded, and having been 
found decidedly againſt the dark policy it 

was

was thought expedient to practiſe, he was 
never afterwards conſulted reſpecting Vi- 
valdi. Parental anxiety and affection 
began to revive as the lengthened ablence 
of his ſon was obſerved. Though jea- 
lous of his rank, he loved Vivaldi ; and, 
though he had never poſitively believed 
that he deſigned to enter into a ſacred 
engagement with a perſon, whom the 
Marcheſe conſidered to be ſo much his 
inferior as Ellena, he had ſuffered doubts, 
which gave him conſiderable uneaſineſs. 
The preſent extraordinary abſence of 
Vivaldi renewed his alarm. He appre- 
hended that if ſhe was diſcovered at this 
moment, when the fear of loſing her for 
ever, and the exaſperation, which ſuch 
complicated oppoſition occaſioned, had 
awakened all the paſſions of his ſon, this 
raſh young man might be prevailed upon 
to ſecure her for his own by the indiſſo- 
luble vow. On the other hand, he 
dreaded the effe&amp; of Viyaldi's deſpair, 

ſhould 


„ 


ſhould he fail in the purſuit; and thus, 
fearing at one moment that for which 
he wiſhed in the next, the Marcheſe 
ſuſfered a tumult of mind inferior only 
to his ſon's. 


The inſtructions, which he delivered 


to the ſervants whom he ſent in purſuit 
of Vivaldi, were given under ſuch diſ- 
traction of thought, that ſcarcely any 
perſon perfectly underſtood his commiſ- 
ſion; and, as the Marcheſa had been 
careful to conceal from him her know- 
ledge of Ellena's abode, he gave no 
direction concerning the rout to San 
Stefano. 

While the Marcheſe at Naples was thus 
employed, and while Schedoni was form- 
ing further plans againſt Ellena, Vivaldi 
was wandering from village to village, 
and from town to town, in purſuit of 
her, whom all his efforts had hitherto 
been unſucceſsful to recover. From the

7 75 at the poſt-houſe at Bracelli, he 
ad obtained little information that could 
direct him; they only knew that a car- 
riage, ſuch as had been already deſcribed 
to Vivaldi, with the blinds drawn up, 
changed horſes there on the morning, 
which he remembered to be that of El- 
lena's departure, and had proceeded on 

the road to Morgagni. 
When Vivaldi arrived thither, all trace 
of Ellena was loſt; the maſter of the 
poſt could not recolle&amp; a ſingle circum- 
ſtance connected with the travellers, and, 
even if he had noticed them, it would 
have been inſufficient for Vivald!'s pur- 
poſe, unleſs he had alſo obſerved the 
road -they followed ; for at this place 
ſeveral roads branched off into oppoſite 
quarters of the country ; Vivaldi, there- 
fore, was reduced to chooſe one of theſe, 
as chance or fancy directed; and, as it 
appeared probable that the Marcheia had 
conveyed 


C20 3 


conveyed Ellena to a convent, he de- 
termined to make enquiries at every one 
on his way. 

He had now paſſed over ſome of the 
wildeſt tracts of the Apennine, among 
ſcenes which ſeemed abandoned by civil- 


1zed ſociety to the banditti who haunted 


their receſſes, Vet even here amidſt 
wilds that were nearly inacceſſible, con- 
vents, with each its {mall dependent ham- 
let, were ſcattered, and, ſhrouded from 
the world by woods and mountains, en- 
joyed unſuſpectedly many of its luxuries, 
and diſplayed, unnoticed, ſome of its ele- 
gance. Vivaldi, who had viſited ſeveral 
of theſe in ſearch of Ellena, had been 
ſurprized at the refined courteſy and hoſ- 
pitality, with which he was received. 

It was on the ſeventh day of his jour- 
ney, and near ſun-ſet, that he was be- 
wildered in the woods of Rugieri. He 
had received a direction for the road he 


was to take, at a village ſome leagues diſ-

tant, and had obeyed it confidently till 
now, when the path was loſt in ſeveral 
tracts that branched out among the 
trees. The day was cloſing, and Vi- 
valdi's ſpirits began to fail, but Paulo, 
light of heart and ever gay, commended 
the ſhade and pleaſant freſhneſs of the 
woods, and obſerved, that if his maſter 
did loſe his way, and was obliged to re- 
main here for the night, it would not be 
ſo very unlucky, tor they could climb up 
among the branches of a cheſtnut, and 
find a more neat and airy lodging than 
any inn had yet afforded them. 

While Paulo was thus endeavouring to 
make the beſt of what might happen, and 
his maſter was ſunk in reverie, they ſud- 
denly heard the ſound of inſtruments and 
voices from a diſtance. The gloom, 
which the trees threw around, prevented 
their diſtinguiſhing objects afar off, and 
not a ſingle human being was viſible, nor 
any trace of his art, beneath the ſhadowy 
ſcene. 


„ 


Tecene. They liſtened to aſcertain from 
what direction the ſounds approached, 
and heard a chorus of voices, accompa- 
nied by a few inſtruments, performing 
the evening ſervice. 

«© We are near a convent, Signor,” 
ſaid Paulo, “ liſten ! they are at their 
devotions.“ 

&lt;« It is as you ſay,” replied Vivaldi; 
% and we will make the beſt of our way 
towards it.“ 

«© Well, Signor! I muſt ſay, if we find 
as. good doings here as we had at the 
Capuchin's, we ſhall have no reaſon to 
regret our beds al-freſto among the 
cheſtnut branches.“ 

Do you perceive any walls or ſpires 
beyond the trees ?” ſaid Vivaldi, as he 
led the way. | 

“None, Signor,“ replied Paulo; 
c yet we draw nearer the ſounds. Ah, 
Signor ! do you hear that note? How it 
dies away! And thoſe inſtruments juſt

Still as they advanced, no walls ap- 
peared, and ſoon after the muſic ceaſed ; 
but other ſounds led Vivaldi forward to 
a pleaſant part of the woods, where, the 
trees opening, he perceived a party of 
pilgrims ſeated on the graſs. They were 
laughing and converſing with much 
gaiety, as each ſpread before him the ſup- 
per, which he drew from his ſcrip; 
while he, who appeared to be the Fa- 
ther- director of the pilgrimage, fat with 
a jovial countenance in the midſt of the 
company, diſpenſing jokes and merry 
ſtories, and receiving in return a tribute 
from every ſcrip. Wines of various ſorts 


were ranged before him, of which he 
drank abundantly, and ſeemed not to 
refuſe any dainty that was offered. 
Vivaldi, whoſe apprehenſions were now 
queted, ſtopped to obſerve the groupe,

as the evening rays, glancing along the 
ſkirts of the wood, threw a gleam upon 
their various countenances, ſhewing, how- 
ever, in each a ſpirit of gaiety that might 
have characterized the individuals of a 
party of pleaſure, rather than thoſe of a 
pilgrimage. The Father- director and his 
flock ſeemed perfectly to underſtand each 
other; the Superior willingly reſigned 
the ſolemn auſterity of his office, and per- 
mitted the company to make themſelves 
as happy as poſſible, in conſideration of 
receiving plenty of the moſt delicate of 
their viands; yet ſomewhat of dignity 
was mingled with his condeſcenſions, 
that compelled them to receive even his 
jokes with a degree of deference, and per- 
haps they laughed at them leſs for their 
ſpirit than becauſe they were favours. 
Addreſſing the Superior, Vivaldi re- 
queſted to be directed how he might re- 


gain his way. The father examined him

for a moment before he replied, but ob- 
ſerving the elegance of his dreſs, and a 
certain air of diſtinction; and perceiving 
alſo, that Paulo was his ſervant, he pro- 
- miſed his ſervices, and invited him to take 
a ſeat at his right hand, and partake of 
the ſupper. | 

Vivaldi, underſtanding that the party 
was going his road, accepted the invita- 
tion ; when Paulo, having faſtened the 
horſes to a tree, ſoon became buſy with 
the ſupper. While Vivaldi converſed 
with the father, Paulo engrofled all the 
attention of the pilgrims near him; 
they declared he was the merrieſt fel- 
low they had ever ſeen, and often ex- 
preſſed a with that he was going as far 
with them as to the ſhrine in a convent 
of Carmelites, which terminated their 
pilgrimage. When Vivaldi underſtood 
that this ſhrine was in the church of a 
convent, partly inhabited by nuns, and 
6 that 


--I0- 3 


that it was little more than a league and a 
half diſtant, he determined to accompany 
them, for it was as poſſible that Ellena 
might be confined there as in any other 
cloiſter ; and of her being impriſoned in 
ſome convent, he had leſs doubt the more 
he conſidered the character and views of 
his mother. He ſet forward, therefore, 
with the pilgrims, and on foot, having 
reſigned his horſe to the weary Father- 
director. 

Darkneſs cloſed over them long before 
they reached the village where they de- 
ſigned to paſs the night; but they beguiled 
the way with ſongs and ſtories, now and 
then, only, ſtopping at command of the 
Father, to repeat ſome prayer or ſing a 
hymn. But, as they drew near a village, 
at the baſe of the mountain on which the 


ſhrine ſtood, they halted to arrange them

horſe, placed himſelf at their head, 
and beginning a loud ſtrain, they pro- 
ceeded in full chorus of melancholy 
muſic. ' 

The peaſants, hearing their ſonorous 
voices, came forth to meet and conduct 
them to their cabins. The village was 
already crowded with devotees, but theſe 
poor peaſants, looking up to them with 
love and reverence, made every poſhble 
contrivance to accommodate all who 
came; notwithſtanding which, when 
Paulo ſoon after turned into his bed of 
ſtraw, he had more reaſons than one to 
regret his cheſtnut mattreſs. 

Vivaldi paſſed an anxious night, wait- 
ing impatiently for the dawning of that 
day, which might poſſibly reſtore to him 
Ellena. Conſidering that a pilgrim's 
habit would not only conceal him from 
ſuſpicion, but allow him opportunities

would not permit, he employed Paulo to 
provide him one. The addreſs of the 
ſervant, aſſiſted by a ſingle ducat, eaſily 
procured it, and at an early hour he fer 
forward on his inquiry.

Bring roſes, violets, and the cold ſnow-drop, 
Beautiful in tears, to ſtrew the pathway 
Of our ſaintly ſiſter. 


Aw devotees only had begun to 
aſcend the mountain, and Vivaldi kept 
aloof even from theſe, purſuing a lonely 
track, for his thoughtful mind deſired 
ſolitude. The early breeze ſighing 
among the foliage, that waved high 
over the path, and the hollow daſhing of 
diſtant waters, he liſtened to with com- 
placency, for theſe were ſounds which 
ſoothed yet promoted his melancholy 
mood; and he ſometimes reſted to gaze 
upon the ſcenery around him, for this 
toa, was in harmony with the temper of 
his mind. Diſappointment had ſub.

dued the wilder energy of the paſſions, 


and produced a ſolemn and lofty ſtate of 
feeling ; he viewed with pleaſing ſadneſs 
the dark rocks and precipices, the gloomy 
mountains and vaſt ſolitudes, that ſpread 
around him; nor was the convent he 
was approaching a leſs ſacred feature of 
the ſcene, as its gray walks and pinnacles 
appeared beyond the duſky groves. 
« Ah! if it ſhould encloſe her!” faid 
Vivaldi, as he caught a firſt glimpſe of its 
hall. Vain hope! I will not invite 
your illuſions again, I will not expoſe 
myſelf to the agonies of new diſappoint- 


ment; I will ſearch, but not JET” 


Yet, if ſhe ſhould be there!“ 


Having reached the gates of the con- 
vent, he paſſed with haſty ſteps into the- 


court; where his emotion increaſed as 


he pauſed a moment and looked round its 


ſilent cloiſters. The porter only appear-

perceive him to be other than a pilgrim,

drew his hood over his face, and, ga- 
thering up his garments ſtill cloſer in his 
folded arms, paſſed on without ſpeaking, 
though he knew not which of the ave- 
nues before him led to the ſhrine. 
He advanced, however, towards the 
church, a {tately edifice, detached, and 
at ſome little diſtance, from the other 
parts of the convent. Its highly-vaulted 
aiſles, extending in twilight perſpective, 
where a monk, or a pilgrim only, now 
and then croſſed, whoſe dark figures, 
paſſing without ſound, vaniſhed like 
ſhadows; the univerſal ſtillneſs of the 
place, the gleam of tapers from the 
high altar, and of lamps, which gave a 
gloomy pomp to every ſhrine in the 
church: —all theſe circumſtances con- 
ſpired to impreſs a ſacred awe upon his 
heart. 

He followed ſome devotees through 
a fide aifle to a court, that was over- 
hung by a tremendous rock, in which 

was 


( 345 ) 

was a cave, containing the ſhrine of on 
Lady of Mount Carmel. This court was 
encloſed by the rock, and by the choir 
of the church, except that to the ſouth 
a ſmall opening led the eye to a glimpſe 
of the landſcape below, which, ſeen be- 
yond the dark jaws of the cliff, appeared 
free, and light, and gaily coloured, melt- 
ing away into blue and diſtant moun- 
tains, 

Vivaldi entered the cave, where, en- 
cloſed within a filigree ſcreen of gold, 
lay the image of the ſaint, decorated with 
flowers and lighted up by innumerable 
lamps and tapers. The ſteps of the ſhrine 
were thronged with kneeling pilgrims, 
and Vivaldi, to avoid ſingularity, kneeled 
alſo; till a high peal of the organ, at a 
diſtance, and the deep voices of choir- 
iſters announced that the firſt maſs was 
begun. He left the cave, and, returning 
into the church, loitered at an extremity 

P5 of 


( 346 ) 
of the aiſles, where he liſtened awhile to 
the ſolemn harmony pealing along the 
Tools, and ſoftening away in diſtance, 
It was ſuch full and entrancing muſic as 
Trequently ſwells in the high feſtivals of 
the Sicilian church, and is adapted to 
inſpire that ſublime enthuſiaſm, which 
ſometimes elevates its diſciples. Vivaldi, 
unable to endure long the exceſs of 
feeling, which this harmony awakened, 
was leaving the church, when ſuddenly 
it cealed, and the tolling of a bell 
founded in its ſtead. This ſeemed to be 
the knell of death, and it occurred to 
him, that a dying perſon was approaching 
to receive the laſt ſacrament ; when he 
heard remotely a warbling of female 
yoices, mingling with the deeper tones of 
the monks, and with the hollow note of 
the bell, as it ſtruck at intervals. So 
ſweetly, ſo plaintively, did the ſtrain grow 
on the air, that thoſe, who liſtened, as 
| well 


(347 ) 


well as thoſe, who ſung, were touched 
with ſorrow, and feemed equally to mourn 
for a departing friend. 

Vivaldi haſtened to the choir, the 
pavement of which was ſtrewn with 
palm-branches and freſh flowers. A pall 
of black velvet lay upon the ſteps of the 
altar, where ſeveral prieſts were filently 
attending. Every where appeared the 


enſigns of ſolemn pomp and ceremony, 


and in every countenance the ſtillneſs and 
obſervance of expectation. Meanwhile 
the ſounds drew nearer, and Vivaldi per- 
ceived a proceſſion of nuns approaching 
from a diſtant aiſle, 


As they advanced, he diſtinguiſhed the 
lady abbeſs leading the train, dreſſed in 
her pontifical robes, with the mitre on 
her head ; and well he marked her ſtately 
ſtep, moving in time to the flow min- 
ſtrelſy, and the air of proud yet graceful 
dignity, with which ſhe characterized 
herſelf, Then followed the nuns, ac-

edrding to their ſeveral orders, and laſt 
came the novices, carrying lighted tapers, 
and ſurrounded by other nuns, who were 
diſtinguiſhed by a particular habit. 

Having reached a part of the church 
appropriated for their reception, they ar- 
ranged themſelves in order. Vivaldi 
with a palpitating heart inquired the 
occaſion of this ceremony, and was told 
that a nun was going to be profeſſed. 

“ You are informed, no doubt, bro- 
ther,” added the friar who gave him this 
intelligence, © that on the morning of 

our high feſtival, our /ady's day, it is 
uſual for ſuch. as devote themſelves to 
heaven, to receive the veil. Stand by a 
while, and you will ſee the ceremony.” 

What is the name of the novice who 
is now to receive it?“ ſaid Vivaldi, in a 
voice whoſe emule accents betrayed 
his emotion. 

The friar glanced an eye of ſcru- 
tiny upon him, as he replied, © I know 
9 not 


( 349 ) 


not her name, but if you will ſtep a 
little this way, I will point her out to 
you.“ | 

Vivaldi, drawing his hood over his 
face, obeyed in ſilence. 

„It is ſhe on the right of the abbeſs,” 
ſaid the ſtranger, © who leans on the 
arm of a nun; ſhe is covered, with a 
white vel, and is taller than her com- 
panions.“ 

Vivaldi obſerved her with a fearful 
eye, and, though he did not recognize 
the perſon of Ellena, whether it was 
that his fancy was poſſeſſed with her 
image, or that there was truth in his 
ſurmiſe, he thought he perceived a re- 
ſemblance of her. He inquired how 
long the novice had reſided in the con- 
vent, and many other particulars, to 
which the ſtranger either could not or 
dared not reply. 

With what anxious ſolicitude did Vi- 


valdi endeavour to look through the 
vells 


CI 9 

veils of the ſeveral nuns in ſearch of EL 
lena, whom he believed the barbarous 
policy of his mother might already have 
devoted to the cloiſter! With a ſolici- 
tude ſtill ſtronger, he tried to catch a 
glimpſe of the features of the novices, 
but their faces were fhaded by hoods, 
and their white veils, though thrown 
half back, were diſpoſed in ſuch artful 
folds that they concealed them from ob- 
ſervation, as effectually as did the pendant 
lawn the features of the nuns. 

The ceremony began with the exhort- 
ation of the Father-Abbot, delivered with 
ſolemn energy ; then the novice kneeling 
before him, made her profeſſion, for 
which Vivaldi liſtened with intenſe atten- 
tion, but it was delivered in ſuch low 
and trembling accents, that he could not 
aſcertain even the tone. But during the 
anthem that mingled with the enſuing 
part of · the ſervice, he thought; he diſ- 
tinguiſhed the voice of Ellena, that touch»

( 351 3 

ing and well-known voice, which in the 
church of San Lorenzo had firſt at. 
tracted his attention. He liſtened, 
ſcarcely daring to draw breath, leſt he 
ſhould loſe a note ; and again he fancied 
her voice ſpoke in a part of the plaintive 
reſponſe delivered by the nuns. 

Vivaldi endeavoured to command his 
emotion, and to await with patience ſome 
further unfolding of the truth ; but when 
the prieſt prepared to withdraw the white 
veil from the face of the novice, and 
throw the black one' over her, a dread- 
ful expectation that ſhe was Ellena ſeized 
him, and he with difficulty forbore ſtep- 
ping forward and Mido reriag himſelf on 
the inſtant. 

The veil was at length withdrawn, and 
a very lovely face appeared, but not El- 
lena's. Vivaldi breathed again, and 
waited with tolerable compoſure for the 
concluſion of the ceremony; till, in the 
ſolemn ſtrain that followed the putting 

OIL 


£308 3 
on of the black veil, he heatd again the 


voice, which he was now convinced was 
her's. Its accents were low, and mourn- 
ful, and tremulous, yet his heart acknow- 
ledged inſtantaneouſly their magic in- 


fluence. 
When this ceremony had concluded, 


another began; and he was told it was 
that of a noviciation. A young woman, 
fupported by two nuns, advanced to the 
altar, and Vivaldi thought he beheld 
Ellena. The prieſt was beginning the 
cuſtomary exhortation, when ſhe lifted 
her half-veil, and, ſhewing a countenance 
where meek ſorrow was mingled with 
heavenly ſweetneſs, raiſed her blue eyes, 
all bathed in tears, and waved her hand 
as if the would have ſpoken. —It was El- 
lena herſelf. 

The prieſt attempted to proceed. 

] proteſt in the preſence of this 
congregation,” ſaid ſhe ſolemnly, © that 
I am brought hither to pronounce

vows which my heart diſclaims. I pro- 
telt”? 

A confuſion of voices interrupted her, 
and at the fame time ſhe perceived Vi- 
valdi ruſhing towards the altar. Ellena 
gazed for a moment, and then, ſtretch- 
ing forth her ſupplicating hands towards 
him, cloſed her eyes, and ſunk into the 
arms of ſome perſons round her, who 
vainly endeavoured to prevent him from 
approaching and aſſiſting her. The an- 
guiſh, with which he bent over her lifeleſs 
form, and called upon her name, ex- 
cited the commiſeration even of the nuns, 
and eſpecially of Olivia, who was moſt 


aſſiduous in efforts to revive her young 


friend. | 
When Ellena uncloſed her eyes, and 


looking up, once more beheld Vivaldi, the 


expreſſion with which ſhe regarded him, 


told that her heart was unchanged, and 


that ſne was unconſcious. of the miſeries 
of impriſonment while he was with her. 
She

She deſired to withdraw, and, aſſiſted 
by Vivaldi and Olivia, was leaving the 
church, when the abbeſs ordered that ſhe 
ſhould be attended by the nuns only; 
and, retiring from the altar, ſhe gave di- 
rections that the young ſtranger ſhould 
be conducted to the parlour of the con- 
vent. 

Vivaldi, though he refuſed to obey an 
imperious command, yielded to the en- 
treaties of Ellena, and to the gentle re- 
monſtrances of Olivia; and, bidding 
Ellena farewell for a while, he repaired 
to the parlour of the abbeſs. He was not 
without ſome hope of awakening her to a 
ſenſe of juſtice, or of pity; but he found 
that her notions of right were inexorably 
againſt him, and that pride and reſent- 
ment uſurped the influence of every other 
feeling. She began her lecture with ex- 
preſſing the warm friendſhip ſhe had ſo 
long cheriſhed: for the Marcheſa, his mo- 
ther, proceeded to lament that the fon 

| of 


6 


of a friend whom ſhe ſo highly eſteemed, 
ſhould have forgotten his duty to his 
parents, and the obſervance due to the 
dignity of his houſe, ſo far as to ſeek 
connection with a perſon of Ellena di 
Roſalba's inferior ſtation ; and concluded 
with a ſevere reprimand for having diſ- 
turbed the tranquillity of her convent 
and the decorum of the church by his 
intruſion. 

Vivaldi liſtened with ſubmitting pa- 
tience to this mention of morals and de- 
corum from a perſon, who, with the moſt 
perfect ſelf-applauſe, was violating ſome 
of the plaineſt obligations of humanity 
and juſtice ; who had conſpired to tear 
an orphan from her home, and who de- 
ſigned to deprive her for lite of liberty, 
with all the bleſſings it inherits. Burt, 
when ſhe proceeded to ſpeak of Ellena 
with the cauſtic of ſevere reprobation, 
and to hint at the puniſhment, which her 
public rejection of the vows had incurred,

the patience of Vivaldi ſubmitted no 
longer ; indignation and contempt roſe 
tugh againſt the Superior, and he exhi- 
bited a portrait of herſelf in the ſtrong 
colours of truth. But the mind, which 
compaſſion could not perſuade, reaſon 
could not appal ; ſelfiſhneſs had hardened 
it alike to the influence of each ; her pride 
only was affected, and ſhe retaliated the 
mortification ſhe ſuffered, by menace and 
denunciation. 


Vivaldi, on quitting her apartment, had 
no other refource than an application to 
the Abate, whoſe influence, at leaſt, if 
not his authority, might aſſuage the ſe- 
verity of her power. In this Abate, a 
mildneſs of temper, and a gentleneſs of 
manner were qualities of leſs value than 
18 uſually and deſervedly imputed to 
them; for, being connected with feeble- 
neſs of mind, they were but the pleaſing 
merits of eaſy times, which in an hour 
of difficulty never aſſumed the character 
of 


(997-3 


of virtues, by inducing him to ſerve thoſe, 
for whom he might feel. And thus, with 
a temper and diſpoſition directly oppoſite 
to thoſe of the ſevere and violent abbeſs, 
he was equally ſelfiſh, and almoſt equally 


culpable, ſince, by permitting evil, he was 


nearly as injurious in his conduct as thoſe 
who planned it. Indolence and timidity, 
a timidity the conſequence of want of 
clear perception, deprived him of all 
energy of character; he was prudent 
rather than wiſe, and ſo fearful of being 
thought to do wrong that he ſeldom did 

right. | 
To Vivaldi's temperate repreſentations 
and earneſt entreaties that he would ex- 
ert ſome authority towards liberating 
Ellena, he liſtened with patience 3 ac- 
knowledged the hardſhips of her ſitua- 
tion; lamented the unhappy diviſions 
between Vivaldi and his family, and then 
declned advancing a ſingle ſtep in ſo 
delicate an affair. Signora di Roſalba, 
he 


(3305 

he ſaid, was in the care of the abbeſs, 
over whom he had no right of control 
in matters relative to her domeſtic con- 
cerns. Vivaldi then ſupplicated, that, 
though he poſſeſſed no authority, he 
would, at leaſt, intercede or remonſtrate 
againſt ſo unjuſt a procedure as that of 
detaining Ellena a priſoner, and aſſiſt in 
reſtoring her to the home, from which 
ſne had been forcibly carried. 

And this, again,” replied the Abate, 
does not come within my juriſdiction ; 
and I make it a rule never to encroach 
upon that of another perſon.” 

„And can you endure, holy father,” 
faid Vivaldi, © to witneſs a flagrant act of 
injuſtice and not endeavour to counteract 
it ; not even ſtep forward to reſcue the 
victim when you perceive the 5 
for the ſacrifice?“ 

« I repeat, that I never interfere with 
the authority of others,“ replied the Su- 
perior ; © having aſſerted my own, I yield 

to 


("399 3 


to them in their ſphere, the obedience 
which I require in mine.“ 

Is power then,“ ſaid Vivaldi, © the 
infallible teſt of juſtice? Is it morality 
to obey where the command is criminal? 
'The whole world have a claim upon the 
fortitude, the active fortitude of thoſe 
who are placed as you are, between the 
alternative of confirming a wrong by 
your conſent, or preventing it by your 
reſiſtance. Would that your heart ex- 
panded towards that world, reverend 
father!“ 

* Would that the whole world were 
wrong that you might have the glory of 
ſetting it right!“ ſaid the Abate, ſmiling. 
„ Young man! you are an enthuſiaſt, 
and I pardon you. You are a knight of 
chivalry, who would go about the earth 
fighting with every body, by way of prov- 
ing your right to do good; it is un- 
fortunate you are born ſomewhat too 


late.“ 
66 Enthu- 


16 

« Enthuſiaſm in the cauſe of human- 
ity” —faid Vivaldi, but he checked him- 
ſelf; and deſpairing of touching a heart 
fo hardened by ſelfiſh prudence, and in- 
dignant at beholding an apathy ſo vicious 
in its conſequence, he left the Abate 
without other effort. He perceived that 
he muſt now have recourſe to further 
ſtratagem, a recourſe which his frank 
and noble mind deteſted, but he had al- 
ready tried, without ſucceſs, every other 
poſſibility of reſcuing the innocent victim 

of the Marcheſa's prejudice and pride. 
Ellena meanwhile had retired to her 
cell, agitated by a variety of conſidera- 
tions, and contrary emotions, of which, 
however, thoſe of joy and tenderneſs 
were long predominant. Then came 
anxiety, apprehenſion, pride, and doubt, 
to divide and torture her heart. It was 
true that Vivaldi had diſcovered her pri- 
ſon, but if it were poſſible that he could 
releaſe her, the muſt conſent to quit it 
with 


6 


with him; a ſtep from which a mind ſo 
tremblingly jealous of propriety as her's, 
recoiled with alarm, though it would de- 
liver her from captivity. And how, 
when ſhe conſidered the haughty cha- 
rafter of the Marcheſe di Vivaldi, the 
imperious and vindictive nature of the 
Marcheſa, and, ſtill more, their united 
repugnance to a connection with her, 
how could ſhe endure to think, even for a 
moment, of intruding herſelf into ſuch a 
family! Pride, delicacy, good ſenſe 
ſeemed to warn her againſt a conduct 
ſo humiliating and vexatious in its con- 
ſequences, and to exhort her to preſerve 
her owa dignity byindependence ; but the 
eſteem, the friendſhip, the tender affec- 
tion, which ſhe had cheriſhed for Vivaldi, 
made her pauſe, and ſhrink with emotions, 
of little leſs than.horror, from the eter- 
nal renunciation, which ſo dignified a 
choice required. Though the encourage- 

VOL. 1. . meut, 


| ( 362 ) 

ment, which her deceaſed relative had 
given to this attachment, ſeemed to im- 
part to it a ſacred character, that con- 
ſiderably ſoothed the alarmed delicacy of 
Ellena, the approbation, thus implied, had 
no power to ſilence her own objections, 
and ſhe would have regretted the miſtaken 
zeal, which had contributed to lead her 
into the preſent diſtreſſing ſituation, had 
ſhe revered the memory of her aunt, or 
foved Vivaldi, leſs. Still, however, the 
joy, which his preſence had occaſioned, 
and which the conſciouſneſs that he was 
ſtill near her had prolonged, was not 
. ſubdued, though it was frequently ob- 
fcured, by ſuch anxious conſiderations. 
With jealous and indiſcreet ſolicitude, 
ſhe now recolle&amp;ed every look, and the 
accent of every word, which had told that 
his affection was undiminiſhed, thus ſeek- 
ing, with inconſiſtent zeal, for a convic- 
tion of the very tenderneſs, which but a 


moment before ſhe had thought it would 
be 


630 


be prudent to lament, and almoſt neceſ- 
ſary to renounce. 

She awaited with extreme anxiety the 
appearance of Olivia, who might proba- 
bly know the reſult of Vivaldi's confer- 
ence with the abbeſs, and whether he 
was yet in the convent. 

In the evening Olivia came, a meſſen- 
ger of evil; and Ellena, informed of the 
conduct of the abbeſs, and the conſequent 
departure of Vivaldi, perceived all her 
courage, and all the halt-formed reſolu- 
tions, which a conſideration of his family 
had ſuggeſted, faulter and expire. Sen- 
ſible only of grief and deſpondency, ſhe 
aſcertained, for the firſt time, the extent 
of her affection and the ſeverity of her 
ſituation. She perceived, alſo, that the 
injuſtice, which his family had exerciſed 
towards her, abſolved her from all con- 
ſideration of their diſpleaſure, otherwiſe 
than as it might affect herſelf ; but this 


22 was 


( 364 ) 


was a conviction which it were now pro- 
bably uſeleſs to admit. 

Olivia not only expreſſed the tendereſt 
- Intereſt in her welfare, but ſeemed deeply 
affected with her ſituation ; and, whether 
it was, that the nun's misfortunes bore | 
ſome reſemblance to Ellena's, or from 
whatever cauſe, it is remarkable that her 
eyes were often filled with tears, while ſhe 
regarded her young friend, and ſhe be- 
trayed ſo much emotion that Ellena 
noticed it with ſurpriſe. She was, how- 
ever, too delicate to hint any curioſity on 
the ſubject ; and too much engaged by a 
nearer intereſt, to dwell long upon the 
circumſtance. 

When Olivia withdrew, Ellena retired 
to her turret, to ſoothe her ſpirits with a 
view of ſerene and majeſtic nature, a re- 
courſe which ſeldom failed to elevate her 
mind and ſoften the aſperities of afflic- 
tion. It was to her like ſweet and ſo- 

lemn 


(44 


lemn muſic, breathing peace over the 
ſoul—like the oaten ſtop of Milton's 
Spirit, 
«Who with his ſoft pipe, and ſmooth- dittied ſong, 
Well knew to ſtill the wild winds when they roar, | 
And huſh the waving woods.“ 

While ſhe ſat before a window, obſerv- 
ing the evening light beaming up the 
valley, and touching all the diſtant moun- 
tains with miſty purple, a reed as ſweet, 


though not as fanciful, ſounded from 
among the rocks below. The inſtrument 


and the character of the ſtrain were ſuch 
as ſhe had been unaccuſtomed to hear 
within the walls of San Stefano, and the 
tone diffuſed over her ſpirits a pleaſing 
melancholy, that rapt all her attention, 
The liquid cadence, as it trembled and 
ſunk away, ſeemed to tell the dejection 
of no vulgar feelings, and the exquiſite 
talte, with which the complaining notes 
were again ſwelled, almoſt convinced her, 
that the muſician was Vivaldi, 


Q 3 On 


{300-2 

On looking from the lattice, ſhe per- 
ceived a perſon perched on a point of the 
cliff below, whither it appeared almoſt 
impracticable for any human ſtep to 
have climbed, and preſerved from the 
precipice only by ſome dwarf ſhrubs that 
fringed the brow. The twilight did not 
permit her immediately to aſcertain whe- 
ther it was Vivaldi, and the ſituation was 
ſo dangerous that ſhe hoped it was not he. 
Her doubts were removed, when, look- 
ing up, he perceived Ellena, and the heard 
his voice. | 
Vivaldi had learned from a lay-brother 
of the convent, whom Paulo had bribed, 
and who, when he worked in the garden, 
had ſometimes ſeen Ellena at the window, 
that ſhe frequented this remote turret ; 
and, at the hazard of his life, he had now 
ventured thither, with a hope of con- 

verſing with her. 
Ellena, alarmed at his tremendous ſitu- 
ation, refuſed to liſten to him, but he 
would 


(367 ) 

would not leave the ſpot till he had com- 
municated a plan concerted for her eſcape, 
and intreating that ſhe would confide 
herſelf to his care, aſſured her ſhe would 
be conducted to wherever ſhe judged 
proper. It appeared that the brother had 
conſented to aſſiſt his views, in conſidera- 
tion of 'an ample reward, and to admit 
him within the walls on this evening, 
when, in his pilgrim's habit, he might 
have an opportunity of again ſeeing El- 
lena. He conjured her to attend, if poſ- 
fible, in the convent parlour during ſup- 
per, explaining, in a few words, the 
motive for this requeſt, and the ſubſtance 
of the following particulars : 


The Lady- abbeſs, in obſervance of the 
cuſtom upon high feſtivals, gave a colla-

A few ſtrangers of diſtinction and pilgrims 
were allo to partake of the entertain-

ments of this night, among which was 
included a concert to be performed by the 
nuns. At the collation was to be diſ- 
played a profuſion of delicacies, arranged 
by the fiſters, who had been buſy in 
preparing the paſtry and confectionary 
during ſeveral days, and who excelled in 
theſe articles no leſs than in embroidrey 
and other ingenious arts. This ſupper 
was to be given in the abbeſs's outer par- 
lour, while ſhe herſelf, attended by ſome 
nuns of high rank, and a few favourites, 
was to have a table in the inner apart- 
ment, where, ſeparated only by the grate, 
ſhe could partake of the converſation of 
the holy fathers. The tables were to be 
ornamented with artificial flowers, and a 
variety of other fanciful devices upon 
which the ingenuity of the ſiſters had been 
long employed, who prepared for theſe 
feſtivals with as much vanity, and ex- 
pected them to diſſipate the gloomy mo- 
notony of their uſual life, with as much 

eagerneſs 


( 369 ) 

eagerneſs of delight, as a young beauty 
anticipates a firſt ball. 
On this evening, therefore, every mem- 
ber of the convent would be engaged 
either by amuſement or buſineſs, and to 
Vivaldi, who had been careful to inform 
himſelf of theſe circumſtances, it would 
be eaſy, with the aſſiſtance of the brother, 
to obtain admittance, and mingle himſelf 
among the ſpeQators, diſguiſed in his 
pilgrim's habit. He entreated, therefore, 
that Ellena would contrive to be in the 
abbeſs's apartment this evening, when he 
would endeavour to convey to her ſome 
further particulars of the plan of eſcape, 
and would have mules in waiting at the 
foot of the mountain, to conduct her 
to Villa Altieri, or to the neighbouring 
convent of the Santa della Pieta. Vi- 
valdi ſecretly hoped that ſhe might be, 
prevailed with to give him her hand on 
quitting San Stefano, but he forbore to 
mention this hope, leſt it ſhould be miſ- 

Q 5 taken 


(- $90 J} 


taken for a condition, and that Ellena 
might be either reluctant to accept his 
aſſiſtance, or, accepting it, might conſider 
herſelf bound to grant a haſty conſent. 


To his mention of eſcape ſhe liſtened 


with varying emotion; at one moment 
attending to it with hope and joy, as pro- 
miſing her only chance of liberation from 
an impriſonment, which was probably in- 
tended to laſt for her life, and of reſtor- 
ing her to Vivaldi; and at another, re- 
coiling from the thought of departing with 
him, while his family was ſo decidedly 
averſe to their marriage. Thus, unable 
to form any inſtant reſolution on the ſub- 
ject, and intreating that he would leave 
his dangerous ſtation before the thicken- 
ing twilight ſhould increaſe the hazard 
of his deſcent, Ellena added, that ſhe 
would endeavour to obtain admittance to 
the apartment of the abbeſs, and to ac- 
quaint him with her final determination. 
Vivaldi underſtood all the delicacy of her 

8 {cruples,

(098-3 


ſcruples, and though they afflicted him, 


he honoured the good ſenſe and juſt pride 
that ſuggeſted them. 


He lingered on the rock till the laſt 
moments of departing light, and then, 
with a heart fluttering with hopes and 
fears, bade Ellena farewell, and deſcended; 
while ſhe watched his progreſs through 
the ſilent gloom, faintly diſtinguiſhing him 
gliding along ledges of the precipice, and 
making his adventurous way from cliff 
to cliff, till the winding thickets concealed 
him from her view. Still anxious, ſhe 
remained at the lattice, but he appeared 
no more; no voice announced diſaſter z 
and, at length, ſhe returned to her cell, 
to deliberate on the ſubject of her de- 
parture. 


Her conſiderations were interrupted 
by Olivia, whoſe manner indicated ſome- 
thing extraordinary; the uſual tranquil- 
lity of her countenance was gone, and an 
air of grief mingled with apprehenſion ap-

peared there. Before ſhe ſpoke, ſhe ex- 
amined the paſlage and looked round the 
cell. It is as I feared,” ſaid ſhe ab- 
ruptly ; “my ſuſpicions are juſtified, and 
you, my child, are ſacrificed, unleſs it 
were poſſible for you to quit the convent 
this night.“ 


« Whar is it that you mean ?”? ſaid the 
alarmed Ellena. 

J have juſt learned,” reſumed the 
nun, that your conduct this morning, 
which is underſtood to have thrown a pre- 
meditated inſult upon the abbeſs, is to be 
puniſhed with what they. call impriſon- 
ment; alas! why ſhould I ſoften the 
truth, —with what I believe is death it- 
ſelf, for who ever returned alive from that 
hideous chamber!“ 

* With death!“ ſaid Ellena, aghaſt 
&amp; Oh, heavens! how have I deſerved 
death?“ 

* 'That is not the queſtion, my daugh- 
ter; but Row you may avoid it. Within

the deepeſt receſſes of our convent, is a 
ſtone chamber, ſecured by doors of iron, 
to which ſuch of the ſiſterhood as have 
been guilty of any heinous offence have, 
from time to time, been conſigned. This 
condemnation admits of no reprieve ; the 
unfortunate captive is left to languiſh in 
chains and darkneſs, receiving only an 
allowance of bread and water juſt ſuffi- 
cient to prolong her ſufferings, till nature, 
at length, ſinking under their intolerable 
preſſure, obtains refuge in death. Our 
records relate ſeveral inſtances of ſuch 
horrible puniſhment, which has generally 
been inflicted upon nuns, who, weary of 
the life which they have choſen under the 
firſt deluſions of the imagination, or which 
they have been compelled to accept by 
the rigour or avarice of parents, have 
been detected in eſcaping from the con- 
vent.“ 


The nun pauſed, but Ellena remain- 


ing rapt in ſilent thought, ſhe reſumed : 


« One 


(294-3 


« One miſerable inſtance of this ſeverity 
has occurred within my memory. I ſaw 
the wretched victim enter that apart- 
ment—never more to quit it alive ! I ſaw, 
alſo, her poor remains laid at reſt in the 
convent garden! During nearly two 
years ſhe languiſhed upon a bed of ſtraw, 
denied even the poor conſolation of con- 


- verſing through the grate with ſuch of 


the ſiſters as pitied her; and who of us 
was there that did not pity her! A ſe- 
vere puniſhment was threatened to thoſe, 
who ſhould approach with any compaſ- 
ſionate intention; thank God! I incur- 
red it, and I endured it, alſo, with ſecret 
triumph.“ 

A gleam of ſatisfaction paſſed over Oli- 
via's countenance as ſhe ſpoke this; it was 
the ſweeteſt that Ellena had ever obſerved 
there. With a ſympathetic emotion, ſhe 
threw herſelf on the boſom of the nun, 
and wept ; for ſome moments they were 
both ſilent, Olivia, at length, ſaid, Do 

| you 


(375 2) 


you not believe, my child, that the offi- 
cious and offended abbeſs will readily 
ſeize upon the circumſtance of your diſ- 
obedience, as a pretence for confining 
you in that fatal chamber ? The wiſhes 
of the Marcheſa will thus ſurely be ac- 
compliſhed, without the difficulty of ex- 
acting your obedience to the vows. Alas! 
I have received proof too abſolute of her 
intention, and that to-morrow is aſſigned 
as the day of your ſacrifice ; you may, 
perhaps, be thankful that the bufineſs of 
the feſtival has obliged her to defer exe- 
cuting the ſentence even till to-mor- 
row.“ 

Ellena replied only with a groan, as 
her head {till drooped upon the ſhoulder 
of the nun; ſhe was not now hefitating 
whether to accept the aſſiſtance of Vi- 
valdi, but deſponding leſt his utmoſt 
efforts for her deliverance ſhould be 
vain,

Ellena, 


(399-3 

Ellena, thus encouraged by the gene- 
rous ſympathy of Olivia, mentioned Vi- 
valdi's purpoſed viſit of this evening; 
and conſulted with her on the probability 
of procuring admittance for herſelf to 
the abbeſs's parlour. Reanimated by this 
intelligence, Olivia adviſed her to repair 
not only to the ſupper-room, but to at- 
tend the previous concert, to which ſe- 
veral ſtrangers would be admitted, among 
whom might probably be Vivaldi. When 
to this, Ellena objected her dread of the 
abbeſs's obſervation, and of the imme- 
diate ſecluſion that would follow, Olivia 
ſoothed her fears of diſcovery, by offering 
her the diſguiſe of a nun's veil, and pro- 
miſing not only to conduct her to the 
apartment, but to afford every poſſible 
aſſiſtance towards her eſcape. 


Among the crowd of nuns, who 


will attend in that ſpacious apartment,“ 
&amp; | Olivia 


„ 


Olivia added, © it is improbable you 
would be diſtinguiſhed, even if the ſiſters 
were leſs occupied by amuſement, and the 
abbeſs were at leiſure to ſcrutinize. As 
it is, you will hazard little danger of diſ- 
covery ; the Superior, it ſhe thinks of you 
at all, will believe you are ſtill a priſoner 
in your cell; but this is an evening of too 
much importance to her vanity, for any 
conſideration, diſtin&amp; from that emotion, 
to divide her attention. Let hape, there- 
fore, ſupport you, my child, and do you 
prepare a few lines to acquaint Vivaldi 
with your conſent to his propoſal, and 
with the urgency of your circum- 
ſtances; you may, perhaps, find an op- 
portunity of conveying them through the 
grate.”? 


They were ſtill converſing on this ſub- 
ject, when a particular chime ſounded, 
which Olivia ſaid ſummoned the nuns to 


the 


1 
the concert- room; and ſhe immediately 
haſtened for a black veil, while Ellena 


wrote the few lines that were neceſſary 
for Vivaldi, 
He, wrapt in clouds of myſtery and ſilence, 

Broods o'er his paſſions, bodies them in deeds, 

And ſends them forth on wings of Fate to others: 
Like the inviſible Will, that guides us, 

Unheard, unknown, unſearchable ! 

That lawn conceals her beauty 
As the thin cloud, juſt filver'd by the rays, 
The trembling moon: think ye *tis ſhrouded from 


The curious eye ? 


; * in Olivia's veil, Ellena de- 
ſcended to the muſic- room, and 
mingled with the nuns, who were aſſem- 
bled within the grate. Among the monks 
and pilgrims without it, were ſome ſtran- 
gers in the uſual dreſs of the country, 


but ſhe did not perceive any perſon who 
reſembled Vivaldi; and ſhe conſidered, 


that, 1f he were preſent, he would not 


venture todiſcover himſelf, while her nun's 
veil concealed her as effectually from him 


„VOL: I's B as 


BY 

as from the lady Abbeſs. It would be ne- 
ceſſary, therefore, to ſeek an opportunity 
of withdrawing it for a moment at the 
grate, an expedient, which muſt however 
expoſe her to the notice of ſtrangers. 

On the entrance of the lady Abbeſs, 
Ellena's fear of obſervation rendered her in- 
ſenſible to every other conſideration; ſhe 
fancied that the eyes of the Superior were 
particularly directed upon herſelf. The 
veil ſeemed an inſufficient protection from 
their penetrating glances, and ſhe almoſt 
ſunk with the terror of inſtant diſcovery. 

The Abbeſs, however, paſſed on, and, 
having converſed for a few moments with 
the padre Abate and ſome viſitors of diſ- 
tinction, took her chair; and the per- 
formance immediately opened with one of 
thoſe ſolemn and impreſſive airs, which 
the Italian nuns know how to give with fo 
much taſte:and ſweetneſs. It reſcued even 
Ellena for a moment from a ſenſe of dan- 
ger, and the reſigned herſelf to the ſur- 
rounding 


0-3-1 

rounding ſcene, of which the coup di 
was ſtriking and grand. In a vaulted 
apartment of conſiderable extent, lighted 
by innumerable tapers, and where even 
the ornaments, though pompous, partook 
of the ſolemn character of the inſtitution, 
were aſſembled about fifty nuns, who, in 
the intereſting habit of their order, ap- 
peared with graceful plainneſs. The deli- 
cacy of their air, and their beauty, ſoftened 
by the lawn that thinly veiled it, were con- 
traſted by the ſevere majeſty of the lady 
Abbeſs, who, ſeated on an clevated chair, 
apart from the audience, ſeemed the Em- 
preſs of the ſcene; and by the venerable 
figures of the father Abate and hisattendant 
monks, who were arranged without that 
ſcreen of wire-work, extending the whole 
breadth of the apartment, which is called 
the grate. Near the holy father were 
placed the ſtrangers of diſtinction, dreſſed 
in the ſplendid Neapolitan habit, whoſe 
gay colouring. and airy elegance oppoſed 

B 2 well 


(4) 
well with the dark drapery of the eccleſiaſ- 
tics; their plumed hats loftily overtopping 
the half-cowled heads and grey locks of the 
monks. Nor was the contraſt of counte- 
nances leſs ſtriking; the grave, the auſtere, 
the ſolemn, and the gloomy, intermingling 
with the light, the blooming, and the de- 
bonaire, expreſſed all the various tempers, 
that render life a bleſſing om burden, and, 
as with the ſpell of magic, transform this 
world intoa tranſient paradiſe or purgatory. 
In the back ground of the picture ſtood 
{ome pilgrims, with looks lefs joyous and 
more demure than they had worn on the 
road the preceding day; and among them 
were {ome inferior brothers and attendants 
of the convent. To this part of the cham- 
ber Ellena frequently directed her atten- 
tion, but did not diſtinguiſh Vivaldi; and, 
though ſhe had taken a ſtation near the 
grate, ſhe had not courage indecorouſly 
to withdraw her veil before ſo many ſtran- 
gers. And thus, if he even were in the 


＋ apartment,

apartment, it was not probable he would 
venture to come forward. 


The concert concluded without his hav- 
ing been perceived by Ellena; and ſhe 
withdrew to the apartment, where the 
collation was ſpread, and where the Abbeſs 
and her gueſts ſoon after appeared. Pre- 
ſently, ſhe obſerved a ſtranger, in a pil- 
grim's habit, ſtation himſelf near the grate; 
his face was partly muffled in his cloak, 
and he ſeemed to be a ſpectator father than 
a partaker of the feaſt. 

Ellena, who underſtood this to be Vi- 
valdi, was watchful for an opportunity of 
approaching, unſcen by the Abbeſs, the 
place where he had fixed himſelf. Engag- 
ed in converſation with the ladies around 
her, the Superior ſoon favoured Ellena's 
with, who, having reached the grate, ven- 
tured to lift her veil for one inſtant. The 
ſtranger, letting his cloak fall, thanked her 
with his eyes for her condeſcenſion, and 
lhe perceived, that he was not Vivaldi

Shocked at the interpretation, which might 
be given to a conduct apparently ſo impro- 
per, as much as by the diſappointment, 
which Vivaldi's abſence occaſioned, ſhe 
was haſtily retiring, when another ſtranger 
approached with quick ſteps, whom ſhe in- 
ſtantly knew, by tlie grace and ſpirit of his 
air, to be Vivaldi; but, determined not to 
be expoſed a ſecond time to the poſſibi- 
lity of a miſtake, ſhe awaited ſilently for 
ſome further ſignal of his identity. His 
eyes were fixed upon her in earneſt at- 
tention, before he drew aſide the cloak 
from his face. But he ſoon did fo ;—and 
it was Vivaldi himſelf, 

Ellena, perceiving that ſhe was known, 
did not raiſe her veil, but advanced a few 
ſteps towards the grate. Vivaldi there de- 
poſited a ſmall folded paper, and before 
ſhe could venture to deliver her own billet, 
he had retired among the crowd. As ſhe 
ſtepped forward to ſecure his letter, ſhe 
oblerved

obſerved a nun haſtily approach the ſpot 
where he had laid it, and ſlie pauſed. The 
garment of the Recluſe wafted it from the 
place where it had been partly concealed; 
and when Ellena perceived the nun's foot 
ret upon the paper, ſhe with AE 
diſguiſed her apprehenſions. 

A iriar, who from without the grate ad- 
dreſſed the fiſter, ſeemed with much ear- 
neſtneſs, yet with a certain air of {ecrecy, 
communicating ſome important intelli- 
gence. The fears of Ellena ſuggeſted that 
he had obſerved the action of Vivaldi, and 
was making known his ſuſpicions; and ſhe 
expected, every inſtant, to fee the nun lift 
up the paper, and deliver it to the Abbels. 

From this immediate apprehenſion, how- 
ever, ſhe was releaſed when the ſiſter 
puſhed it gently aſide, without examina- 
tion, a circumſtance that not leſs ſurprized 
than relieved her. But, when the confe- 
rence broke up, and the friar, haſtily 
retreating among the crowd, diſappeared 


B 4 from

from the apartment, and the nun ap- 
proached and whiſpered the Superior, all 
her terrors were renewed. She ſcarcely 
doubted, that Vivaldi was detected, and 
that his letter was deſignedly left where it 
had been depoſited, for the purpoſe of al- 
luring her to betray herſelf. Trembling, 
diſmayed, and almoſt ſinking with appre- 
henſion, ſhe watched the countenance of 
the Abbeſs, while the nun addreſſed her, 
and thought ſhe read her own fate in the 

frown that appeared there. 
Whatever might be theintentions or the 
directions of the Superior, no active mea- 
ſure was at preſent employed; the Recluſe, 
having received an anſwer, retired quietly 
among the ſiſters, and the Abbeſs reſumed 
her uſual manner. Ellena, however, ſup- 
poſing ſhe was now obſerved, did not dare 
to feize the paper, though ſhe believed it 
contained momentous information, and 
feared that the time was now eſcaping, 
which might facilitate her deliverance. 
| Whenever

Whenever ſhe ventured to look round, 
the eyes of the Abbeſs ſeemed pointed up- 
on her, and ſhe judged from the poſition 
of the nun, for the veil concealed her face, 
that ſhe alſo was vigilantly regarding her. 

Above an hour had elapſed in this ſtate 
of anxious ſuſpenſe, when the collation 
concluded, and the aſſembly broke up; 
during the general buſtle of which, Ellena 
ventured to the grate, and ſecured the pa- 
per. As ſhe concealed it in her robe, ſhe 
ſcarcely dared to enquire by a haſty glance 
whether ſhe had been obſerved, and would 
have withdrawn immediately to examine 
the contents, had ſhe not perceived, at 
the ſame inſtant, the Abbeſs quitting the 
apartment. On looking round for the nun, 
Ellena diſcovered that ſhe was gone. 
Elena followed diſtantly in the Abbeſs's 
train; and, as ſhe drew nearer to Olivia, gave 
a ſignal, and paſſed on to her cell. There, 
once more alone, and having ſecured the 
door, ſhe ſat down to read Vivaldi's billet,

trying to command her impatience, and to 
underſtand the lines, over which her ſight 
rapidly moved, when, in the eagerneſs of 
turning over the paper, the lamp dropt 
from her trembling hand and expired. 
Her diſtreſs now nearly reached deſpair. 
To go forth into the convent for a light 
was utterly impracticable, ſince it would 
betray that ſhe was no longer a priſoner, 
and not only would Olivia ſuffer from a 
diſcovery of the indulgence ſhe had grant- 
ed, but ſhe herſelf would be immediately 
confined. Her only hope reſted upon Oli- 
via's arrival before it might be too late to 
practice the inſtructions of Vivaldi, if, in- 
deed, they were ſtill practicable; and ſhe 
liſtened with intenſe ſolicitude for an ap- 
proaching footſtep, while ſhe yet held, ig- 
norant of its contents, the billet, that pro- 
bably would decide her fate. A thouſand 
times ſhe turned about the eventful paper, 
endeavoured to trace the lines with her fin- 


gers, and to gueſs their import, thus enve- 
loped 


EO, 
| loped in myſtery; while ſhe experienced 
all the various torture that the conſciouſ- 
neſs of having in her very hand the infor- 
mation, on a timely knowledge of which 
her life, perhaps, depended, without being 
able to underſtand it, could inflict. 
Preſently ſhe heard advancing ſteps, and 
a light gleamed from the paſſage before 
ſhe conſidered they might be ſome other 
than Olvia's ; and that it was prudent to 
conceal the billet ſhe held. The conſider- 
ation, however, came too late to be acted 
upon; for, before the ruſtling paper was 
diſpoſed of, a perſon entered the cell, and 
Ellena beheld her friend. Pale, trembling, 
and filent, ſhe took the lamp from the nun, 
and, eagerly running over Vivaldi's note, 
learned, that at the time it was written, 
brother Jeronimo was in waiting without 
the gate of the nun's garden, where Vivaldi 
deſigned to join him immediately, and con- 
duct her by a private way beyond the walls. 
He added, that horſes were ſtationed at the 
. B 6 foot 


E 
foot of the mountain, to convey her where- 
ever ſhe ſhould judge proper; and conjured 
her to be expeditious, ſince other circum- 
ſtances, beſides the univerſal engagement 
of the Recluſes, were at that moment par- 
cularly favourable to an eſcape. 

Ellena, deſponding and appalled, gave 
the paper to Olivia, requeſting ſhe would 
read it haſtily, and adviſe her how to act. 
It was now an hour and a half fince Vivaldi 
had faid, that ſucceſs depended upon ex- 
pedition, and that he had probably watch- 
ed at the appointed place ; in ſuch an in- 
terval, how many circumſtances might 
have occurred to deſtroy every poſſibility 
of a retreat, which it was certain the en- 
gagement of the Abbeſs and the ſiſters no 
longer favoured ! 

The generous Olivia, baving read the 

billet, partook of all her young friend's 
Aiſſtreſs, and was as willing, as Ellena was 
anxious, to dare every danger for the 
chance of obtaining deliverance. 


Ellena 


{18 3 
Ellena could feel gratitude for ſuch 
goodneſs even at this moment of agoniz- 
ing apprehenſion. After a pauſe of deep 
conſideration, Olivia ſaid, © In every ave- 
nue of the convent we are now liable to 
meet ſome of the nuns ; but my veil, 
though thin, has hitherto protected you, 
and we muſt hope it may ſtill aſſiſt your 
purpoſe. It will be neceſſary, however, to 
pals through the refectory, where ſuch of 
the ſiſters as did not partake of the colla- 
tion, are aſſembled at ſupper, and will re- 
main ſo, till the firſt mattin calls them to 
the chapel. If we wait till then, I fear it 
will be to no purpole to go at all.” 
Ellena's fears perfectly agreed with thoſe 
of Olivia; and entreating that another mo- 
ment might not be loſt in heſitation, and 
that ſhe would lead the way to the nun's 
garden, they quitted the cell together. 
Several of the ſiſters paſſed them, as they 
deſcended to the refectory, but without 
particularly noticing Ellena ; who, as ſhe 
drew 


( 14 ) 

drew near that alarming apartment, wrapt 
her veil cloſer, and leaned with heavier 
preſſure upon the arm of her faithful friend. 
At the door they were met by the Abbeſs, 
who had been overlooking the nuns aſſem- 
bled at ſupper, and miſſing Olivia had en- 
quired for her. Ellena ſhrunk back to 
elude obſervation, and to let the Superior 
paſs; but Olivia was obliged to anſwer to 
the fummons. Having, however, unveiled 
herſelf, ſhe was permitted to proceed; and 
Ellena, who had mingled with the crowd 
that ſurrounded the Abbeſs, and thus eſ- 
caped detection, followed Olivia with fal- 
tering ſteps, through the refectory. The 
nuns were luckily too much engaged by 
the entertainment, at this moment, to 
look round them, and the fugitive reacu- 
ed, unſuſpected, an oppoſite door. 

In the hall; to which they deſcended, 
the adventurers were frequently croffed by 
ſervants bearing diſhes from the refectory 
to the kitchen ; and, at the very moment 

when 


{W-4 
when they were opening the door that led 


into the garden, a ſiſter, who had obſerved 
them, demanded whether they had yet 
heard the mattin-bell, fince they were 
going towards the chapel. 

Terrified at this critical interruption, 
Ellena preſſed Olivia's arm, in ſignal of ſi- 
lence, and was haſtening forward, when the 
latter, more prudent, pauſed, and calmly 
anſwering the queſtion, was then ſuffered 
to proceed. 

As they croſſed the garden towards the 
gate, Ellena's anxiety leſt Vivaldi ſhould 
have been compelled to leave it, encreaſed 
ſo much, that ſhe had ſcarcely power to 
proceed. O, if my ſtrength ſhould fail 
before I reach it !” ſhe ſaid ſoftly to Olivia, 
* or if I ſhould reach it too late!“ 

Olivia tried to cheer her, and pointed 
out the gate, on which the moonlight fell ; 
At the end of this walk only,” ſaid 
Olivia, © ſee !—where the ſhadows of the 
trees open, 15 our goal,” 

Encou-

' Encouraged: by the view of it; Ellena 
Med with lighter ſteps along the alley; but 
the gate ſeemed to mock her approach, 
and to retreat before her. Fatigue overtook 
her in this long avenue, before ſhe could 
overtake the ' {ſpot ſo anxiouſly” ſought, 
and, breathleſs and exhauſted, ſhe was 
once more compelled to.ſtop, and once 
more in the agony of terror exclaimed— 
O, if my ſtrength ſhould. fail before I 
reach it !—O, if I ſhould drop even while 
it is within my view!“ 
Ihe pauſe of a moment enabled her to 
proceed, and ſhe ſtopped not again till ſhe 
arrived at the gate; when Olivia ſuggeſted 
the prudence of aſcertaining who was with- 
out, and of receiving an anſwer to the ſig- 
nal, which Vivaldi had propoſed, before 
they ventured to make themſelves known. 
She then ſtruck upon the wood, and, in the 
anxious pauſe that followed, whiſpering 
voices were diſtinctly heard from without, 
but no ſignal ſpoke. in reply to the nun's. 

| Ye: 


* 

te We are betrayed !” ſaid Ellena ſoftly, 
e but I will know the worſt at once ;” and 
ſhe repeated the ſignal, when, to her un- 
ſpeakable joy, it was anſwerea by three 
{mart raps upon the gate. Olivia, more 
diſtruſtful, would have checked the ſud- 
den hope of her friend, til} ſome further 
proof had appeared, that it was Vivaldi 
who waited without, but the precaution 
came too late : a key already grated in the 
lock ; the door opened, and two perfons 
muffled in theirgarments preſented them- 
ſelves. Ellena was haſtily retreating, when 
a well-known voice recalled her, and ſhe 
perceived, by the rays of a half-hooded 
lamp which Jeronimo held, Vivaldi. 

“ O heavens !* he exclaimed, in a voice 
tremulous with joy, as he took her hand, 
eis it poſſible that you are again my own | 
If you could but know what I have ſuffer- 
ed during this laſt hour! Then obſerv- 
ing Olivia, he drew back, till Ellena ex- 

| preſſed 


(18. 
preſſed her deep tenſe of obligation to the 
nun. 
« We have no time to loſe,“ ſaid Jeroni- 
mo ſullenly; we have ſtayed too long al- 
ready, as you will find, perhaps.“ 

« Farewel, dear Ellena!“ ſaid Olivia, 
may the protection of heaven never leave 
you!“ 

The fears of Ellena now gave way to 
affectionate ſorrow, as, weeping on the 
boſom of the nun, ſhe ſaid © farewel! O 
farewel, my dear, my tender friend! I muſt 
never, never ſee you more, but I ſhall always 
love you; and you have promiſed, that I 
ſhall hear from you ; remember the con- 
vent della Piẽta!“ 

* You ſhould have ſettled this matter 
within,” ſaid Jeronimo, © we have been 
here theſe two hours already.” 

Ah Ellena ! ſaid Vivaldi, as he gently 
diſengaged her from the nun,“ do I then 
hold only the ſecond place in your heart?“ 

Ellena, 


Dy 

Ellena, as ſhe diſmiſſed her tears, replied 
with a ſmile more eloquent than words; 
and when ſhe had again and again bade 
adieu to Olivia, ſhe gave him her hand, 
and quitted the gate. 

It is moonlight,” obſerved Vivaldi to 
Jar * your lamp is uſeleſs, and may 
betray us. 

It will be neceſſary in the church,” re- 
plied Jeronimo, “ and in ſome circuitous 
avenues we mult paſs, for I dare not lead 
you out through the great gates, Signor. 
as you well know.“ 

* Lead on, then,” replied Vivaldi, * 
they reached one of the cypreſs walks, that 
extended to the church; but, before they 
entered it, Ellena pauſed and looked back 
to the garden gate, that ſhe might ſee Oli- 
via once again. The nun was ſtill there, 
and Ellena perceived her faintly in the 
moonlight, waving her hand in ſignal of a 
laſt adieu. Ellena's heart was full; ſhe 
wept, and lingered, and returned the ſig- 

nal, 


( 20 ) 
nal, till the gentle violence of Vivaldiwith- 
drew her from the ſpot. 

« Lenvy your friend thoſe tears,” ſaid 
he, © and feel jealous of the tenderneſs that 
excites them. Weep no more, my El- 
lena.“ 

If you knew her worth,” replied El- 
lena, © and the obligations I owe her! 
Her voice was loſt in ſighs, and Vivaldi 
only preſſed her hand in filence. 

As they traverſed the gloomy walk, that 
led to the church, Vivaldi faid, © Are you 
certain, father, that not any of the brothers 
are doing penance at the ſhrines in our 
way?“ 

* Doing penance on a feſtival, Signor! 
they are more likely, by this time, to be 
taking down the ornaments.” | 

„That would be equally unfortunate 
for us,” ſaid Vivaldi; cannot we avoid 
the church, father?“ 

Jeronimo aſſured him, that this was im- 
Poſſible; and they immediately entered 


ONE

one of its lonely aiſles, where he unhooded 
the lamp, for the tapers, which had given 
ſplendour, at an earlier hour, to the nu- 
merous ſhrines, had expired, except thoſe 
at the high altar, which were ſo remote, 
that their rays faded into twilight long be- 
fore they reached the part of the church 
where the fugitives paſſed. Here and 
there, indeed, a dying lamp ſhot a tremu- 
lous gleam upon the ſhrine below, and va- 
niſhed again, ſerving to mark the diſtances 
in the long perſpective of arches, rather 
than to enlighten the gloomy ſolitude; 
put no ſound, not even of a whiſper, ſtole 
along the pavement. 

They crofled to a ſide door communi- 
cating with the court, and with the rock, 
which enſhrined the image of our Lady of 
mount Carmel. There, the ſudden glare of 
tapers iſſuing from the cave, alarmed the 
fugitives, who had begun to retreat, when 
Jeronimo, ſtepping forward toexamine the 
place, affured them there was no ſymp- 

| tom 


„ 
tom of any perſon being within, and that 
lights burned day and night around the 
ſhrine. 

Revived by this explanation, they fol- 
lowed into the cave, where their conduc- 
tor opened a part of the wire-work encloſ- 
ing the ſaint, and led them tothe extremity 
of the vault, ſunk deep within which ap- 
peared a {mall door. While Ellena trem- 
bled with apprehenſion, Jeronimo applied 
a key, and they perceived, beyond the 
door, a narrow paſſage winding away into 
the rock. The monk was leading on, but 
Vivaldi, who partook of the ſuſpicions of 
Ellena, pauſed at the entrance, and de- 
manded whither he was conducting them. 

To the place of your deſinaticu,“ replicd 
the brother, in a hollow voice; an anſwer 
which alarmed Ellena, and did not fatisfy 
Vivaldi. © I have given myſelf to your 
guidance,” he ſaid, © and have confided 
to you what is dearer to me thanexiſtence. 
Your life, pointing to the ſhort ſword

concealed beneath his pilgrim's veſt,“ your 
life, you may rely upon my word, ſhall 
anſwer for your treachery. If your pur- 
poſe is evil, pauſe a moment, and repent, 
or you ſhall not quit this paſſage alive.” 
Do you menace me!“ replied the 
brother, his countenance darkening. Of 
what ſervice would be my death to you ?, 
Do you not know that every brother in the 
convent would rife to avenge it?“ 

« I know only that I will make ſure of 
one traitor, if there be one,“ ſaid Vivaldi, 
* and defend this lady againſt your hoſt of 
monks ; and, ſince you alſo know this, 
proceed accordingly.” 

At this inſtant it occurring to Ellena, that 
the paſſage in queſtion probably led to the 
priſon- chamber, whichOlivia had deſcribed 
as ſituated within ſome deep receſs of the 
convent, and that Jeronimo had certainly 
betrayed them, ſhe refuſed to go further. 
« If your purpoſe is honeſt,” ſaid ſhe, 
* why do you not conduct us through 
| ſome 


( 24 ) 

ſome direct gate of the convent ; why are 
we brought into theſe ſubterraneous laby- 
rinths ?”? | 
here is no direct gate but that of the 
portal,” Jeronimo replied, and this is 
*the only other avenue leading beyond the 
walls.” And why can we not go out 

through the portal?“ Vivaldi aſked. 

_ « Becauſe it is beſet with pilgrims, and 
lay brothers,” replied Jerommo, “ and 
though you might paſs them ſafely enough, 
what is to become of the lady? But all 
this you knew before, Signor; and was 
willing enough to truſt me then. The 
paſſage we are entering opens upon the 
cliffs, at ſome diſtance. I have run ha- 
zard enough already, and will waite no 
more time; ſo if you do not chuſe to go 
forward, I will leave you, and you may act 
as you pleaſe.” 

He concluded with a laugh of deriſion, 
and was re-locking the door, whenVivaldi, 


alarmed for the probable conſequence of 
his 


„ 
his reſentment, and ſomewhat re- aſſured 
by the indifference he diſcovered as to their 
purſuing the avenue or not, endeavoured 
to appeaſe him, as well as to encourage 
Ellena; and he ſucceeded in both. 

As he followed in ſilence through the 
gloomy paſſage, his doubts were, however, 
not ſo wholly vanquiſhed, but that he 
was prepared for attack, and while he ſup- 
ported Ellena with one hand, he held his 
ſword in the other. | 

The avenue was of conſiderable length, 
and before they reached its extremity, they 


heard muſic from a diſtance, winding 


along the rocks. Hark !” cried Ellena, 
« Whence come thoſe ſounds? Lil- 
ten!“ 

From the cave we have left,“ replied 
Jeronimo, “ and it is midnight by that; 
it is the laſt chaunt of the pilgrims at the 
ſhrine of our Lady. Make haſte, Signor, 
I ſhall be called for.”

The fugitives now perceived, that all 
retreat was cut off, and that, if they had 
lüingered only a few moments longer in the 

cave, they ſhould have been ſurprized by 
thoſe devotees, ſome one of whom, how- 
cver, it appeared poſſible might wander 
into this avenue, and ſtill interrupt their 
eſcape. When Vivaldi told his apprehen- 
ons, Jeronimo, with an arch ſneer, affirm- 
ed there was no danger of that, © for the 
paſſage,” he added, “ is known only to 
the brothers of the convent.” 

Vivaldi's doubts vaniſhed when he fur- 
ther underſtood, that the avenue led only 
from the clifls without to the cave, and 
was uſed for the purpoſe of conveying ſe- 
cretly to the ſhrine, ſuch articles as were 
judged neceſſary to excite the ſuperſtitious 
wonder of the devotees. 

While he proceeded in thoughtful 
filence, a diſtant chime ſounded hollowly 
through the chambers of the rock. © The

mattin- bell ſtrikes!“ ſaid Jeronimo, in 
ſeeming alarm, I am ſummoned. Sig- 
nora quicken your ſteps ;”” an unneceſſary 
requeſt, for Ellena already paſſed with 
her utmoſt ſpeed; and ſhe now rejoiced 
on perceiving a door in the remote wind- 
ing of the paſſage, which ſhe believed 
would emancipate her from the convent, 
But, as ſhe advanced, the avenue appear- 
ed extending beyond it; and the door, 
which ſtood a little open, allowed her a 
glimpſe of a chamber in the cliff duſkily 
lighted. 

Vivalvi, alarmed by the light, enquired, 
when he had paſſed, whether any perſon 
was in the chamber, and received an equi- 
vocal anſwer from Jeronimo, who, how- 
ever, ſoon after pointed to an arched gate 
that terminated the avenue. They pro- 
ceeded with lighter fteps, for hope now 
cheared their hearts, and, on reaching the 
gate, all apprehenſion vaniſhed. Jeroni- 
mo gave the lamp to Vivaldi, while he 

C 2 began 


( 28 ) 

began to unbar and unlock the door, and 
Vivaldi had prepared to reward the brother 
for his fidelity, before they perceived that 
the door refuſed to yield. A dreadful ima- 
gination ſeized on Vivaldi. Jeronimo 
turning round, cooly ſaid, © I fear we 
are betrayed ; the ſecond lock is ſhot ! 1 
have only the key of the firſt.” 

« We are betrayed,” ſaid Vivaldi, in a 
reſolute tone, © but do not ſuppoſe, that 
your diſſimulation conceals you. I under- 
ſtand by whom we are betrayed. Recollect 
my late affertion, and conſider once more, 
whether it is your intereſt to intercept us.” 

« My Signor,“ replied Jeronimo, 1 
do not deceive you when I proteſt by our 
holy Saint, that I have not cauſed this 
gate to be faſtened, and that I would open 
it if I could. The lock, which holds it, 
was not ſhot an hour ago. I am the more 
ſurprized at what has happened, becauſe 
this place is ſeldom paſſed, even by the 
holieſt footſtep; and I fear, whoever has 
paſled 


( 29 ) 
paſſed now, has been led hither by {uſpt- 
ion, and comes to intercept your ſliglit.“ 
« Your wily explanation, brother, may 
ſerve you for an inferior occaſion, but not 
on this,“ replied Vivaldi, © either, there- 
fore, uncloſe the gate, or prepare for the 


worſt, You are not now to learn, that, 


however ſlightly I may eſtimate my own 
life, I will never abandon this lady to the 
horrors which your community have al- 
ready prepared for her.” 

Elena, ſummoning her fleeting ſpirits, 
endeavoured to calm the indignation of Vi- 


valdi, and to prevent the conſequence of 


his ſuſpicions, as well as to prevail with Je- 
ronimo, to unfaſten the gate. Her efforts 
were, however, followed by a long alterca- 
tion ; but, at length, the art or the inno- 
cence of the brother appeaſed Vivaldi, 
who now endeavoured to force the gate, 
while Jeronimo in vain repreſented its 
ſtrength, and the certain ruin that muſt

that he had concurred in deſtroying it. 
The gate was immoveable; but, as no 
other chance of eſcaping appeared, Vival- 
di was not eaſily prevailed with to deſiſt ; 
all poſſibility of retreating too was gone, 
ſince the church and the cave were now 
crowded with devotees, attending the mat- 
itn ſervice. 
Jeronimo, however, ſeemingly did not 
deſpair of effecting their releaſe, but he ac- 


knowledged that they would probably be 


compelled to conceal themſelves in this 


gloomy avenue all night, and perhaps the 
next day. At length, it was agreed, that 
he ſhould return to the church, to examine 
whether a poſſibility remained of the fugi- 
tives paſſing unobſerved to the great por- 
tal; and, having conducted them back to 
the chamber, of which they had taken

by Olivia of the priſon where the nun had

mote and ſolitary, amazed her ſtill more 
when ſhe recollected the aſſertion of Jero- 
nimo, that even holy ſteps ſeldom paſſed 
this way; and when ſhe conſidered alſo, 
that he had expreſſed no ſurpriſe at a cir- 
cumſtance, according to his own aſſertion, 
ſo unuſual. Again it appeared, that ſhe 
had been betrayed into the very priton, 
deſigned for her by the Abbets ; and the 
horror, occaſioned by this ſuppoſition, was 
ſo great, that ſhe was on the point of diſ- 
cloſing it to Vivaldi ; but an apprehenſion 
of the deſtruction into which his deſperate 
courage might precipitate him, reſtrained 
her. 

While theſe conſiderations occupied El- 
lena, and it appeared that any certainty 
would be leſs painful than this ſuſpenſe, 
ſhe frequently looked round the chamber 
in ſearch of ſome object, which might con- 
tradict or confirm her ſuſpicion, that this 


was the death-room of the unfortunate 


nun.

aun. No ſuch circumſtance appeared, but, 
as her eyes glanced, with almoſt phrenzied 
eagerneſs, ſhe perceived ſomething ſha- 
dowy 1n a remote corner of the floor ; and, 
on approaching, diſcovered what ſeemed a 
dreadful hieroglyphic, a mattraſs of ſtraw, 
in which ſhe thought ſhe beheld the 
death-bed of the miſerable recluſe ; nay 
more, that the impreſſion it {till retained, 
was that, which her form had left there. 

While Vivaldi was yet entreating her 
to explain the occaſion of the horro: 
ſhe betrayed, the attention. of each was 


withdrawn by a hollow ſigh that roſe 


near them. Ellena caught unconſciouſly 
the arm of Vivaldi, and liſtened, aghaſt, 
for a return of the ſound, but all remain- 
ed ſtill. 

lt ſurely was not fancied |” faid Vayal- 
di, after a long pauſe,“ you heard it allo | 2

It was a ſigh, was it not?“ he added. 

O yes, and ſuch a figh !'? 

8 8 Some 


( 34 ) 
© Some perſon is concealed near us,” 
obſerved Vivaldi, looking round; “ but 
be not alarmed, Ellena, I have a ſword.” 


« A ſword ! alas! you know not 
But hark ! there, again !” 

That was very near us!“ ſaid Vivaldi. 
This lamp burns ſo ſickly !''——and he 
held it high, endeavouring to penetrate the 
furtheſt gloom of the chamber. Hah ! 
who goes there ?” he cried, and ſtepped 
ſuddenly forward; but no perſon appeared, 
and a filence, as of the tomb, returned. 

If you are in forrow, ſpeak !” Vivaldi, 
at length, faid ; © from feHow-ſufferers you 
will meet with ſympathy. If your deſigns 
are evil tremble, for you thall find 1 am 
deſperate.” 

Still no anſwer was returned, and he 
carried forward the lamp to the oppoſite 
end of the chamber, where he perceived a 
{mall door in the rock. At the fame in- 
tant he heard from within, a low tremu- 
lous ſound, as of a perſon in prayer, or in

which, to his ſurprize, yielded immediate-

An unaffected ſurprize appeared in the 


air of the monk; but Vivaldi, notwith- 


ſtanding the intereſting benignity of his 
countenance, feared to anſwer his enqui- 
ries, till the father hinted to him, that an 
explanation was neceſſary, even to his own 
ſafety. Encouraged by his manner, rather 
than intimidated by this hint, and per- 
ceiving, that his fituation was deſperate,

Vivaldi confided to the friar ſome partial 
knowledge of his embarraſſment. 

While he ſpoke, the father liſtened with 
deep attention, looked with compaſſion al- 
ternately upon him and Ellena; and ſome 
haraſſing objection ſeemed to contend 
with the pity, which urged him to aſſiſt 
the ſtrangers. He enquired how long Jero- 
nimo had been abſent, and ſhook his head 
ſignificantly when he learned that the gate 
of the avenue was faſtened by a double 
lock. “Lou are betrayed, my children“ 
ſaid he, © you have truſted with the ſim- 
phcity of youth, _ the cunning of age. 


has deceived you.” 


This terrible conviction affected Ellena 
to tears; and Vivaldi, ſcarcely able to 
command the indignation, which a view of 
ſuch treachery excited, was unable to offer 
her any conſolation. 

* You, my daughter, I remember to 
have ſeen in the church this morning,” 
obſerved the friar; © I remember too, that

I had only a choice of evils,” Ellena 
replied. 

„Holy father,“ ſaid Vivaldi,“ I will 
not believe, that you are one of thoſe, who 
either aſſiſted in or approved the periecu- 
tion of innocence. If you were acquainted 
with the misfortunes of this lady, you 
would pity, and fave her; but there is now 
no time for detail; and I can only conjure 
you, by every ſacred confideration, to aſſiſt 
her to leave the convent.! If there were 
leiſure to inform you of the unjuſtifiable 
means, which have been employed to bring 
her within theſe walls—if you knew that 
ſhe was taken, an orphan, from her home 
at midnight that armed ruffians brought 
her hither and at the command of ſtran- 
gers that ſhe has not a ſingle relation ſur- 
viving to aſſert her right of independence,

Vivaldi was unable to proceed. 

The friar again regarded Ellena with 
compaſſion, but {till in thoughtful filence. 
« All this may be very true,” at length he 
ſaid, „but - and he heſitated.

immediately !—while you heſitate, we are 
loſt. Even nowl think I hear the foot- 
ſteps of Jeronamo.” 

He ſtepped ſoftly to the door of the 
chamber, but all was yet ſtill. The friar, 
too, hſtened, but he alſo deliberated ; 
while Ellena, with a look of eager ſuppli- 
cation and terror, awaited his deciſion. 

No one is approaching,“ ſaid Vivaldi, 
&amp; 1t is not yet too late Good father 
H you would ſerve us, diſpatch.“ 

« Poor 


Or 


( 39 ) 

&amp; Poor innocent !” ſaid the friar, half to 
himſelf, © in this chamber—in this fatal 
place! 

In this chamber !”” exclaimed Ellena, 
anticipating his meaning. It was in this 
chamber, then, that a nun was ſuffered to 
periſh ! and I, no doubt, am conducted 
hither to undergo a ſimilar fate!“ 

In this chamber!“ re-cchoed Vivaldi, 
in a voice of deſperation. * Holy father, 
if you are indeed diſpoſed to aſſiſt us, let 
us act this inſtant; the next, perhaps, may 
render your beſt intentions unavailing!“ 

The friar, who had regarded Elena 
while ſhe mentioned the nun, with the 
utmoſt ſurprize, now withdrew his atten- 
tion; a few tears fell on his cheek, but 
he haſtily dried them, and ſeemed ſtrug- 
gling to overcome ſome grief that was 
deep in his heart. | 

Vivaldi, finding that entreaty had no 
power to haſten his decifion, and expect- 
ing every moment to hear the approach of

Jeronimo, paced the chamber in agonizing 


perturbation, now pauſing at the door to 


liſten, and then calling, though almoſt 
hopeleſſly, upon the humanity of the friar 
while Eliena, looking round the room in 
ſhuddering horror, repeatedly exclaimed, 
On this very ſpot ! in this very chamber! 
O what ſufferings have theſe walls wit- 
neſſcd! what are they yet to witneſs !” 

Vivaldi now endeavoured to ſoothe the 
fpirits of Ellena, and again urged the friar 
to employ this critical moment in faving 
her; O heaven!“ ſaid he, © if the is now 
diſcovered, her fate is certain!“ 

« dare not fay what that fate would 
be,” interrupted the father, © or what my 
own, ſhould I conſent to aſſiſt you; but,

gotten to feel for others! They may op-

me to the gate; we will fee whether my 
key cannot unfaſten all the locks that hold 
it,” 

Vivaldi and Ellena immediately fol- 
lowed the feeble ſteps of the old man, who 
frequently ſtopped to liſten whether Jero- 
nimo, or any of the brothers, to whom the 
latter might have betrayed Ellena's ſitua- 


tion, were approaching; but not an echo 


wandered along the lonely avenue, till they 
reached the gate, when diſtant footſteps 


Veat upon the ground. 


They are approaching, father!“ whiſ- 
pered Ellena, “O, if the key ſhould not 
open theſe locks inſtantly, we are loſt ! 
Hark now I hear their voices—they call 
upon my name! Already they have diſ- 
covered we have left the chamber.” 

While the friar, with trembling hands, 
applied the key, Vivaldi endeayoured at 
once to aſſiſt him, and to encourage El- 
lena. 

The locks gave way, and the gate opened

at once upon the moonlight mountains, 
Ellena heard once more, with the joy of li- 
berty, the midnight breeze paſſing among 
the penſile branches of the palms, that 
loftily overſhadowed a rude platform be- 
fore the gate, and ruſtling with fainter 
found among the pendent ſhrubs of the 
ſurrounding cliffs. | 

There is no leiſure for thanks, my 
children,“ ſaid the friar, obſerving they 
were about to ſpeak. * I will faſten the 
gate, and endeavour to delay your pur- 
ſuers, that you may have time to eſcape. 
My bleſting go with you!“ 

Ellena and Vivaldi had ſcarcely a mo- 
ment to bid him © farewel !”” before he 
cloſed the door, and Vivaldi, taking her 
arm, was haſtening towards the place 
where be had ordered Paulo to wait with 
the horſes, when, on turning an angle of 
the convent wall, they perceived a long 
train of pilgrims iſſuing forth from the 
portal, at a little diſtance,

Vivaldi drew back; yet dreading every 
moment, that he lingered near the monaſ- 
tery, to hear the voice of Jeronimo, or 
other perſons, from the avenue, he was 
ſometimes inclined to proceed at any ha- 
zard. The only practicable path leading 
to the. baſe of the mountain, however, was 
now occupied by theſe devotees, and to 
mingle with them was little leſs than cer- 
tain deſtruction. A bright moonlight 
ſhewed diſtinctly every figure that moved 
in the ſcene, and the fugitives kept within 


the ſhadow of the walls, till, warned by an 


approaching footſtep, they croſſed to the 
feet of the cliffs that roſe beyond ſome ' 
palmy hillocks on the right, whoſe duſky 
receſſes promiſed a temporary ſhelter. 
As they paſſed with filent ſteps along the 
winding rocks, the tranquillity of the land- 
ſcape below afforded an affecting contraſt 
with the tumult and alarm of their minds. 
Being now at ſome diſtance from the 
monaſtery, they reſted under the ſhade of 
the 


( 44 ) 

the cliffs, till the proceſſion of devotees, 
which were traced deicending among the 
thickets and hollows of the mountain, 
ſhould be ſufficiently remote. Often they 
tooked back to the convent, expecting to 
lee lights ĩſſue from the avenue, or the por- 
tal; and attended in mute anxiety for the 
ſullen murmurs of purſuit ; but none 
came on the breeze; nor did any gleam- 

ing lamp betray the ſteps of a ſpy. 
Releaſed, at length, from immediate 
apprehenſion, Ellena liſtened to the mat- 
tin-hymn of the pilgrims, as it came upon 
the ſtill air and aſcended towards the 
cloudleſs heavens. Not a found mingled 
with the holy ſtrain, and even 1n the mea- 
ſured pauſe of voices only the trembling of 
the foliage above was diſtinguiſhed. The 
reſponſes, as they ſoftened away in diſ- 
tance, and ſwelled again on the wafting 
breeze, appeared like the muſic of ſpirits, 
watching by night upon the ſummits of 
the mountains, and anſwering each other 
in 


( 45 ) 
in celeſtial airs, as they walk their liglh 
boundary, and overlook the fleeping 
world. 


« How often, Ellena, at this hour,” 
faid Vivaldi,“ have I lingered round your 
dwelling, conſoled by the conſciouſneſs of 
being near you! Within thoſe walls, I 
have ſaid, ſhe repoſes; they encloſe my 
world, all without is to me a deſart. Now, 
I am in your preſence! O Ellena ! now 
that you are once more reſtored to me, ſuf- 
fer not the caprice of poſſibility again to 
ſeparate us ! Let me lead you to the firſt 
altar that will confirm our vows.” 

Vivaldi forgot, in the anxiety of a 
ſtronger intereſt, the delicate filence he 
had reſolved to impoſe upon himſelf, till 
Ellena ſhould be in a place of ſafety. 

This is not a moment,“ ſhe replied, 
with heſitation, „for converſation; our 
ſituation is yet perilous, we tremble on the 
very brink of danger.” 

I Vivaldi 


„ 

Vivaldi immediately roſe; “ Into what 
imminent danger,” ſaid he, © had my ſelf. 
iſh folly nearly precipitated you] We are 
lingering in this alarming neighbourhood, 
when that feeble ſtrain indicates the pil- 
grims to be ſufficiently remote to permit 
us to proceed!“ 

As he ſpoke, they deſcended cautiouſly 
among the cliffs, often looking back to 
the convent, where, however, no light ap- 
peared, except what the moon ſhed over 
the ſpires and tall! windows of its cathedral. 
For a moment, Ellena fancied ſhe ſaw a 
taper in her favourite turret, and a belief 
that the nuns, perhaps the Abbeſs herſelf 
were ſearching for her there, renewed her 
terror and her ſpeed. But the rays were 
only thoſe of the moon, ſtriking through 
oppolite caſements of the chamber and the 
ſugitives reached the baſe of the mountain 
without further alarm, where Paulo ap- 
peared with horſes. Ah! Signor mo,” ſaid 

| the 


„ 
the ſervant, © I am glad to fee you alive 
and merry; I began to fear, by the length 
of your ſtay, that the monks had clapped 
you up to do penance for lite. How glad 
am to ſee you, Maeſtro |! 

Not more ſo than I am to ſee you, 
good Paulo. But where 1s the pilgrim's 
cloak I bade you provide?“ 

Paulo difplayed it, and Vivaldi, having 
wrapt it round Ellena, and placed her on 
horſeback, they took the road towards 
Naples, Ellena defigning to take refuge in 
the convent della Pieta. Vivaldi, how- 
ever, apprehending that their enemies 
would ſeek them on this road, propoſed 
leaving 1t as ſoonas practicable, and reach- 
ing the neighbourhood of Villa Altieri by 
a circuitous way. 

They ſoon after arrived at the tremen- 
daous pals, through which Ellena had ap- 
proached the monaſtery, and whoſe hor- 

rors were confiderably heightened at this 
- duſky hour, for the moonlight fell only 

&gt; partially 


E 

partially upon the deep barriers of the 
defile, and frequently the precipice, with 
the road on its brow, was entirely ſhadow- 
ed by other cliffs and woody points that 
roſe above it. But Paulo, whoſe ſpirits 
ſeldom owned the influence of local 
ſcenery, jogged merrily along, frequently 
congratulating himſelf and his maſter on 
their eſcape, and carolling briſkly to the 
echoes of the rocks, till Vivaldi, appre- 
henſive for the conſequence of this loud 
gaiety, deſired him to deſiſt, 

« Ah Signor 10 / J muſt obey you,” ſaid 
he, «© but my heart was never ſo full in my 
life; and I would fain fing to unburden 
it of ſome of this joy. That ſcrape we got 
into in the dungeon there, at what's the 
name of the place? was bad enough, but it 
was nothing to this, becaule here I was left 
out of it; and you, Mae/ro, might have 
been murdered again and again, while I, 
thinking of nothing at all, was quietly air- 
ing myſelf on the mountain by moonlight.

But what is that yonder in the ſky, 
Signor? It looks for all the world like a 
bridge; only it is perched ſo high, that 
nobody would think of building one in 
ſuchanout-of-the-way place, unleſs to croſs 
from cloud to cloud, much leſs would 
take the trouble of clambering up after it, 
for the pleaſure of going over.“ 

Vivaldi looked forward, and Ellena per- 
ceived the Alpine bridge, ſhe had former- 
ly croſſed with ſo much alarm, in the 


moonlight perſpective, airily ſuſpended 


between tremendous cliffs, with the river 
far below, tumbling down the rocky 


chaſm. One of the ſupporting cliffs, with 
Part of the bridge, was in deep ſhade, but 


the other, feathered with fohage, and the 


-- Tiling ſurges at its foot, were ſtrongly illu- 


mined ; and many a thicket wet with the 
ſpray, ſparkled in contraſt to the dark 


rock it overhung. Beyond the arch, the 


long-drawn proſpect faded into miſty 


1 light. 


VOL, IT. D Well, 


($0. 

Well, to be fare !” exclaimed Paulo, 
ce to ſee what curioſity will do! If there 
are not ſome people have found their way 
up to the bridge already.“ 

Vivaldi now perceived figures upon the 
ſlender arch, and, as their indiſtin&amp; forms 
glided in the moon-ſhine, other emotions 
than thoſe of wonder diſturbed him, leſt 
theſe might be pilgrims going to the ſhrine 
of our Lady, and who would give infor- 
mation of his route. No poſlibility, how- 
ever, appeared of avoiding them, for the 
precipices that roſe immediately above, 
and fell below, forbade all excurſion, and 
the road itſelf was ſo narrow, as ſcarcely 
#0 admit of two horſes paſſing each other. 
„They are all off the bridge now, and 
without having broken their necks, per- 
haps !” ſaid Paulo, where, I wonder, 
will they go next ! Why ſurely, Signor, 
this road does not lead to the bridge 
yonder; we are not going to pick our way 
in the air too? The roar of theſe waters 
| has 


„ 
has made my head dizzy already; and the 
rocks here are as dark as midnight, and 
ſeem ready to tumble upon one; they are 
enough to make one deſpair to look at 
them; you need not have checked my 
mirth, Signor.“ 

* I would fain check your loquacity,” 
rephed Vivaldi. Do, good Paulo, be 
ſilent and circumſpect, thoſe people may 
be near us, though we do not yet ſec 
them.“ 

„The road does lead to the bridge, 
then Signor!”” ſaid Paulo doloroully. 


And ſee! there they are again; winding 
round that cliff, and coming towards us.“ 


« Huſh! they are pilgrims,” whiſpered 


Viraldi, © we will linger under the ſhade 


of theſe rocks, while they paſs. Remem- 


ber, Paulo, that a ſingle indiſcreet word 
may be fatal; and that if they hail us, I 
alone am to anſwer.” 


« You are obeyed, Signor.“ 
The fugitives drew up cloſe under the 


| | cliffs, and proceeded ſlowly, while the 


D 2 words 


4.32 

words of the devotees, as they advanced, 
became audible. 

It gives one ſome comfort,” {aid Paulo, 
* to hear cheerful voices, in ſuch a place as 
this, Bleſs their merry hearts! their's 
ſeems a pilgrimage of pleaſure ; but they 
will be demure enough, I warrant, by 
and bye. I wiſh I”: 

«* Paulo! have you ſo ſoon forgot?“ 
ſaid Vivaldi ſharply. 

The devotees, on percciving the tra- 
vellers, became ſuddenly filent ; till he 
who appeared to be the Father-direfor, as 


they paſſed, ſaid © Hail! in the name of 


Our Lady of Mount Carmel!“ and they 
repeated the ſalutation in chorus. 

% Hail!” replied Vivaldi, © the firſt 
maſs is over,“ and he paſſed on. 

« But if you make haſte, you may come 
in for the ſecond,” ſaid Paulo, Being 
after. 

*« You have juſt left the ſhrine, then?“ 
ſaid one of the party, * and can tell us“ 

| % Poor 


"28 \ 


(337 

* Poor pilgrims, like yourſelves,” replied 
Paulo, “ and can tell as little. Good mor- 
row, tathers, yonder peeps the dawn!“ 

He came up with his maſter, who had 
hurried forward with Ellena, and who now 
ſeverely reproved his indiſcretion ; while 
the voices of the Carmelites, ſinging the 
matin-hymn, ſunk away among the rocks, 
and the quietnefs of ſolitude returned. 

* Thank heaven! we are quit of thus 


adventure,“ faid Vivaldi. 


And now we have only the bridge to 
get over,“ rejoined Paulo, © and, I hope, 


we ſhall all be ſafe.” 


They were now at the entrance of it; 
as they paſſed the trembling planks, and 


| looked up the defile, a party of people ap- 
- peared advancing on the road the fugitives 


had left, and a chorus of other voices than 

thoſe of the Carmelites, were heard min- 

gling with the hollow ſound of the waters. 
Ellena, again alarmed, haſtened for- 


ward, and Vivaldi, though he endeavoured 


D 3 to 


E 
to appeaſe her apprehenſion of purſuit, en- 
couraged her ſpeed. | 

ITheſe are nothing but more pilgrims 
Signora,“ ſaid Paulo, or they would 
not fend ſuch loud ſhouts before them; 
they muſt needs think we can hear.” 

The travellers proceeded as faſt as the 
broken road would permit; and were ſoon 
beyond the reach of the voices; but as 
Paulo turned to look whether the party 
was within ſight, he perceived two perſons, 
wrapt -in cloaks, advancing under the 
brow of the cliffs, and within a few paces 
of his horſe's heels. Before he could give 
notice to his maſter, they were at his ſide. 

« Are you returning from the ſhrine of 
our Lady! ſaid one of them. 

Vivaldi, ſtartled by the voice, looked 
round, and demanded who aſked the queſ- 
tion ? | 

« A brother pilgrim,” replied the man, 
* one who has toiled up theſe ſteep rocks, 


till his limbs will ſcarcely bear him fur- 
ther. 


„ 
ther. Would that you would take com- 
paſſion on him, and give him a ride.“ 

However compaſſionate Vivaldi might 
be to the ſufferings of others, this was not 
a moment when he could indulge his diſ- 
poſition, without endangering the ſafety 


of Ellena; and he even fancied the ſtran- 
ger ſpoke in a voice of diſſimulation. His 
ſuſpicions ſtrengthened when the traveller, 


not repulſed by a refuſal, enquired the way 
he was going, and propoſed to join his 


party; For theſe inountains, they ſay, 


are infeſted with banditti,”” he added, 


and a large company is leſs likely to be 


attacked than a ſmall one.“ 

e It you are ſo very weary, my friend,” 
ſaid Vivaldi, © how is it poſſible you can 
keep pace with our horſes? though I ac- 


knowledge you have done wonders in over- 


taking them,” 


Ihe fear of theſe banditti,” replied 
the ſtranger, « urged us on.“ 


* You have nothing to apprehend from 
| D 4 robbers,” 


( 56 ) 
robbers,” ſaid Vivaldi, © if you will only 
moderate your pace; for a large company 
of pilgrims are on the road, who will ſoon. 
overtake you.” 

He then put an end to the converſation, 
by clapping ſpurs to his horſe, and the 
ſtrangers were ſoon left far behind. The 
inconſiſtency of their complaints with their 
ability, and the whole of their manner, 
were ſerious ſubjects of alarm to the fu- 
gitives; but when they had loſt ſight of 
them, they loſt alſo their apprehenſions; 
and having, at length, emerged from the 
paſs, they quitted the high road to Naples, 


and ſtruck into a ſolitary one that led 


weſtward towards Aquila.

F ROM the ſummit of a mountain, the 


morning light ſhewed the travellers the 
diſtant lake of Celano, gleaming at the 


feet of other lofty mountains of the Apen- 


nine, far in the ſouth. Thither Vivaldi 
judged it prudent to direct his courſe, for 
the lake lay ſo remote from the immediate 
way to Naples, and from the neighibour- 


hood of San Stefano, that it's banks pro- 


miſed a ſecure retreat. He conſidered, 
alto, that among the convents ſcattered 
along thoſe delightful banks, might caſily 


be found a prieſt, who would folemnize 


their nuptials, ſhoukl Ellena conſent to 


an immediate marriage. 


Ds The 


E 

The travellers deſcended among olive 
woods, and ſoon after were directed by 
ſome peaſants at work, into a road that 
leads from Aquila to the town of Celano, 
one of the very few roads which intrudes 
among the wild mountains, that on every 
fide ſequeſter the lake. As they approach- 
ed the low grounds, the ſcent of orange 
bloſſoms breathed upon the morning air, 
and the ſpicy myrtle ſent forth all its fra- 
grance from among the cliffs, which it 
thickly tufted. Bowers of lemon and 
orange ſpread along the valley; and among 
the cabins of the peaſants, who cultivated 
them, Vivaldi hoped to obtain repoſe and 
refreſhment for Ellena. 

The cottages, however, at which Paulo 
enquired were unoccupied, the owners be- 
ing all gone forth to their labour : and 
the travellers, again aſcending, found them- 
ſelves ſoon after among mountains inha- 
bited by the flocks, where the ſcent of the 


Orange 


(39-3 


orange was exchanged for the aromatic 
' perfume of the paſturage. 


« My Signor!“ ſaid Paulo, © is not that 


a ſhepherd's horn ſounding at a diſtance ? 


If fo, the Signora may yet obtain ſome 


refreſhment.” 


While Vivaldi liſtened, a hautboy and a 
paſtoral drum were heard conſiderably 
nearer. 


They followed the ſound over the turf, 


and came within view of a cabin, ſheltered 
from the ſun by a tuft of almond trees. 
It was a dairy-cabin belonging to ſome 


ſhepherds, who at a ſhort diſtance were 
watching their flocks, and, ſtretched be- 


neath the ſhade of cheſnuts, were amuſe 
ing themſelves by playing upon theſe rural 
- inſtruments ;. a ſcene of Arcadian manners 
frequent at this day, upon the mountains 
of Abruzzo. The ſimplicity of their ap- 


pearance, approaching to wildneſs, was 
tempered by a hoſpitable ſpirit. A vene- 


4 rable man, the chief ſhepherd, advanced.

fo meet the ſtrangers; and, learning their 
wants, conducted them into his coolcabin, 
where cream, cheele made of goat's milk, 
honey extracted from the delicious herbage 
of the mountains, and dried figs were 
quickly placed before them. | 

Ellena, overcome with the fatigue of 
anxiety, rather than that of travelling, re- 
tired, when ſhe had taken breakfaſt, for an 
hour's repoſe; while Vivaldi reſted on the 
bench before the cottage, and Paulo, keep- 
ing watch, diſcuſſed his breakfaſt, toge- 
ther with the circumſtances of the late 
alarm, under the ſhade of the almond trees. 

When Ellena again appeared, Vivaldi 
propoled, that they ſhould reſt here dur- 
ing the intenſe heat of the day; and, ſince 
he now conſidered her to be in a place of 
temporary ſafety, he ventured to renew the 
ſubject neareſt his heart ; to repreſent the 
evils, that might overtake them, and to 
urge an immediate ſolemnization of their 
marriage. 


Thoughtful 


(08-7 
Thoughtful and dejected, Ellena at- 
tended for ſome time in ſilence to the ar- 
guments and pleadings of Vivaldi. She 
ſecretly acknowledged the juſtneſs of his 
repreſentations, but ſhe ſhrunk, more than 


ever, from the indelicacy, the degradation 


of intruding herſelf into his family; a fa- 
mily, too, from whom {he had not only 
received proofs of ſtrong diſlike, but had 
ſuffered terrible injuſtice, and been me- 
naced with ſtill ſeverer cruelty. Theſe 
latter circumſtances, however, releaſed her 
from all obligations of delicacy or genero- 
fity, ſo far as concerned only the authors 
of her ſuffering ; and ſhe had now but to 
conſider the happineſs of Vivaldi and her- 


ſelf. Yet ſhe could not decide thus pre- 
cipitately on a ſubject, which fo folemnly 


involved the fortune of her whole life; nor 


forbear reminding Vivaldi, affectionately, 


gratefully, as ſne loved him, of the cir- 
cumſtances which with-held her deciſion.

bluſhed, and burſt into tears. 

Spare me the view of thoſe tears, 
ſaid Vivaldi, „and a recolle&amp;ion of the 
circumſtances that excite them. O, let 
me not think of my mother, while I ſee 
you weep | Let me not remember, that 
her injuſtice and cruelty deſtined. you to 
perpetual ſorrow !”? 

Vivaldi's features became agitated: 
while he ſpoke; he roſe, paced the 
room with quick ſteps, and then quitted 
it, and walked under the ſhade of the 
trees in front of the cabin. 

In a few moments, however, he com- 
manded his emotion and returned. Again. 
he placed himſelf on the bench beſide 
Ellena, and taking her hand, ſaid ſolemn- 
lx, and in a voice of extreme ſenſibility,

Ellena was affected, and for ſome mo- 


ments unable to reply. At length, dry- 


ing her tears, ſhe ſaid tenderly, © Reſent- 


ment can have no influence on my con- 
duct towards you; I think I feel none

you could renounce me?“ he repeated,

« Believe!” repeated Vivaldi,“ will you

gratitude : and why that unneceſſary reſer- 
vation? Yet even this aſſurance, feebly as 
it ſuſtains my hopes, is extorted ; you ſee 


my miſery, and from pity, from gratitude, 


not affection, would aſſuage it. Beſides,

« But I will not diftreſs you; forgive me

cept our goats, and fome of them do ſtray

have ceaſed their capering, and ſtood peep- 
ing over a crag ſo ſly, and ſo quiet, it 
ſeemed as if they were laughing at me; 
as much as to ſay, Catch us if you 
can.” 


Vivaldi, who during the latter part of 
this ſpeech had been conſulting with 8 
Ellena, 


6 


Erllcna, whether they ſhould proceed on 


their way immediately, aſked the boy ſome 
further queſtions concerning the Carme- 
lites ; and becoming convinced that they 
had either not taken the road to Celano, 
or, having taken it, were at a conſiderable 
diſtance, he propoſed ſetting out, and pro- 


ceeding leiſurely, © For I have now little

&gt; Ellena approving the plan, they took 
| Jeave of the good ſhepherd, who with 


difficulty was prevailed with to accept 
any recompence for his trouble, and who 
gave them {ome further directions as to the 
road: and their way was long cheered by 
the ſound of the tabor and the ſweetneſs 
of the hautboy, wafted over the wild. 

2 When they deſcended into the woody 
E 5 hollow 


( 82 ) 
hollow mentioned by the boy, Ellena ſent i 
forth many an anx1ous look beneath the 3 
deep ſhade ; while Paulo, ſometimes ſilent, 7 
and at others whiſtling and ſinging loudly, 2 
as if to overcome his fears, peeped under 
every bough that croſſed the road, ex- 
pecting to diſcover his friends, the Carme- 
lites, lurking within its gloom. | 
Having emerged from this valley, the 
road lay over mountains covered with 
flocks, for it was now the ſeaſon when they 
had quitted the plains of Apulia, to feed 
upon the herbage for which this region is 
celebrated; and it was near ſun-ſet, when, 
from a ſummit to which the travellers had 
long been aſcending, the whole lake of 
Celano, with its vaſt circle of mountains, 5 
burſt at once upon their view. _—

the labour of the aſcent. The evening

bet water, between eighteen and twenty leagues

convents, that enriched the riſing ſhores;

permitted him to diſcriminate the minute

We ſcarcely dare to truſt the truth of

« Signor,” cried Paulo, I have been 
thinking, that while we are taking the air 
{o much at our eaſe, here, thoſe Carmelites 
may be ſpying at us from ſome hole or 
corner that we know nothing of, and may 
ſwoop upon us all of a ſudden, before we

on, Signor?“

% Ay, Signora, it is beſt to be of the 
ſafe fide,” obſerved Paulo. Yonder, be- | 
low, is Celano, and I hope we ſhall get ſafe 
houſed there before it is quite dark, for 
here we have no mountain, that will light 
us on our way if we {hould happen to be 
benighted! Ah ! if we were but within 
twenty miles of Naples, now,—and it was 
an i/[umination night — 

As they deſcended the mountain, Elle- 
na, ſilent and dejected, abandoned herſelf 
to reflection. She was too ſenſible of the 
difficulties of her preſent fituation, and 
t00-avorehenſty,&gt; of the aden which

her determination muſt have on all her ſu- 
ture life, to be happy, though eſcaped 
from the priſon of San Stefano, and in the 
preſence of Vivaldi, her beloved deliverer 
and protector. He obſerved her dejec- 
tion with grief, and, not underſtanding all 
the finer ſcruples that diſtreſſed her, in- 


terpreted her reſerve into indifference to- 


wards himſelf. But he forbore to diſturb 
her again, with a mention of his doubts 
or 


(40.7 q 
or fears; and hedetermined not to urge the Y 
ſubject of his late intreaties, till he ſhould 
have placed her in ſome ſecure aſylum, 
where ſhe might feel herſelf at perſect li- 
berty to accept or to rejcct his propoſal. 
By acting with an honour ſo delicate, he 
unconſciouſly adopted a certain means of 
increaſing her eſteem and gratitude, and 
deſerved them the more, ſince he had to 
endure the apprehenſion of loſing her by the 
delay thus occaſioned to their nuptials. 
They reached the town of Celano be- 
fore the evening cloſed; when Vivaldi was 
requeſted by Ellena to enquire for a con- 
vent, where ſhe might be lodged for the 
night. He left her at the inn, with Paulo 
for her guard, and proceeded on his ſearch. 
The firſt gate he knocked upon belonged 
to a ſociety of Carmelites.. It appeared

We own clafs, in preference to that of any 
other, Vivaldi thought it prudent to retire 
from their gates, without making himſelf 
W known. He paſſed on, therefore, and 
5 ſoon after arrived at a convent of Domi- 
5 nicans, where he learned, that there were 
only two houſes of nuns in Celano, and 
chat theſe admitted no other boarders than 
permanent ones. 

7 Vivaldi returned with this information 
: to Ellena, who endeavoured to reconcile 
WT herſelf to the neceſſity of remaining where 
ſhe was; but Paulo, ever active and zea- 
lous, ſoon brought intelligence, that at a 
little fiſhing town, at ſome diſtance, on 
the bank of the lake, was a convent of 
5 Urſalines, remarkable for their hoſpitality 
W to ſtrangers. The obſcurity of ſo remote a 
place, was another reaſon for preferring it 
to Celano, and Vivaldi propoſing to ro- 
move

ummed:ately {et off, .

« Every thing repoles,” obſerved Vival-

« Yes, I believe you are right, Paulo,

The travellers deſcended the gradual

X ſome time after, exclaimed, © See, Signor, 
EF. | where another light glides along! See! it 


is reflected on the lake.“ 

&lt; I hear the faint daſhing of waves, 
now,” ſaid Ellena, and the found of 
ears, too. But obſerve, Paulo, the light 
1s not in the town, it is in the bot that 
moves yonder.“ 

« Now it retreats, and trembles in a 
lengthening line upon the dark waters,” 
added Vivaldi. We have been too ready 
co believe what we wiſh, and have yet far 
to go.“ 


| The ſhore.they were approaching form- 
3 ed a ſpacious bay for the lake, immediate- 
2 ly below. Dark woods ſeemed to ſpread 
2 along the banks, and aſcend among the 
cultivated ſlopes towards the mountains; 
| ; except where, here and there, cliffs, bend- 
5 mg over the water, were diſtinguiſhed 
W through the twilight by the whiteneſs of 
W their limeſtone precipices. Within the 
| bay, 


„ 
bay, the town became gradually viſible; 
lights twinkled between the trees, appear- 
ing and vaniſhing, like the ſtars of a cloudy 
night; and, at length. was heard the me- 
lancholy ſong of boatmen, who were fiſh- 
ing near the ſhore. 

Other ſounds ſoon after ſtruck the ear. 
« O, what merry notes! exclaimed Paulo, 
* they make my heart dance. See! Sig- 
nora, there is a group, footing it away ſo 
gaily on the bank of the lake, yonder, by 
thoſe trees where the water glimmers 
O, what a merry ſet! Would I were 
among them! that is, I mean, if you, 
Maeſtro, and the Signora were not here.” 

Well corrected, Paulo.“ 

It is a feſtival, I fancy,” obſerved Vi- 
valdi. Theſe peaſants of the lake can 
make the moments fly as gaily as the vo- 
luptuaries of the city, it ſeems.” 

O what merry muſic'!” repeated 
Paulo. Ah! how often I have footed it

Pere now! That is, I mean, if you, 
Moeſro, and the Signora were there too. 
P! what merry notes!“

0 a ng the margin of the lake; and having 
— i quired for the Urſaline convent, were 
an rected to its gates. The portreſs ap- 


'0- gared immediately upon the ringing of 

e bell, and carried a meſſage to the 
ed | 4 Pbels, who returning an invitation to 
I it

rtreſs to the parlour, while Vivaldi

remained at the gate, till he ſhould know 


whether ſhe approved of her new lodg- 


ing. A ſecond invitation induced him, 
alſo, to alight; he was adnutted to the 
orate, and offered refreſhment, which, 
however, he declined ſtaying to accept, 


as he had yet a lodging to ſeek for the a 
night. The Abbeſs, on learning this cir- 5 


cumſtance, courteouſly recommended him 
to a neighbouring ſociety of Benedictines, 
and deſired him to mention her name to 
the Abbot. 


Vivaldi then took leave of Ellena, and, © : 


though it was only for a few hours, he left 
her with dejection, and with ſome degree 


of apprehenſion for her ſafety, which, 


though circumſtances could not juſtity 


him in admitting, he could not entirely? 3 
ſubdue. She ſhared his dejection, but not 
his fears, when the door cloſed after him, f 5 
and ſhe found herſelf once more among

could not be entirely overcome by the at. |

which ſeemed more than was due to a

eagerly eſcaped to the apartment allotted 
for her, and to the repoſe from which ſhe 
had ſo long been withheld. 

Vivaldi, meanwhile, had found an hoſ-

them. In the eagerneſs of converſation,

would urge all his reaſons and entreaties 
for an immediate marriage ; and among 
the brothers of the Benedictine, he had 
little doubt of prevailing with one to ſo-

Vivaldi was ſuffering the utmoſt vexation,

not leſs apprehenſion, that the abode of 
Ellena might be diſcovered; yet this

forebodings of diſappointed pride. 

A circumſtance, which rendered her 
particularly ſuſceptible to ſuch diſappoint- 
ment at this time, was, that overtures of 
alliance had been lately made to the Mar- 
cheſe, by the father of a lady, who was held 
ſuitable, in every conſideration, to become 
his daughter; and whoſe wealth rendered 
the union particularly deſirable at a time, 
when the expences of ſuch an eſtablifh- 
ment was as neceſſary to the vanity of the 
Marcheſa, conſiderably exceeded his in- 
come, large as it was. 

The Marcheſa's temper had been thus 
irritated by the contemplation of her ſon's 


conduct, in an affair which ſo materially 
affected the fortune, and, as ſhe believed, 


the honour of his family; when a courier 


from the Abbeſs of San Stefano brought Þ

overcome her circumſpection, as to compel 
her to acquaint the Marcheſe with the 
2 contents of the Abbeſs's letter before ſhe 
had conſulted with her Confeſſor. She 


| 3 knew that the principles of her huſband

In the evening Schedoni came, but it 
He, 
too, had heard of the eſcape of Ellena, as 
well as that ſhe was on the lake of Celano, 
and was married to Vivaldi. How he had 
obtained this information he did not chuſe 
to diſcloſe, but he mentioned ſo many mi- 
nute circumſtances in confirmation of its 
truth, and appeared to be to perfectly con- 
vinced of the facts he related, that the 
Marcheſa believed them, as implicitly as 
himſelf; and her paſſion and deſpair tranſ- 
greſſed all bounds of decorum. 

Schedoni obſerved, with dark and ſilent 
pleaſure, the turbulent exceſs of her feel- 
ings; and perceived that the moment was 
now arrived, when he might command 
them to his purpoſe, ſo as to render his 
aſſiſtance indiſpenſable to her repoſe; and, 


Probably, ſo as to accompliſh the revenge 
bee had long meditated againſt Vivaldi,

without hazarding the fayour of the Mar- 
cheſa. So far was he from attempting to 
ſoothe her ſufferings, that he contrived to 
irritate her reſentment, and exaſperate her 
pride; effecting this, at the ſame time, 
with ſuch conſummate art, that he ap- 
peared only to be palliating the conduct 
of Vivaldi, and endeavouring to conſole 
his diſtracted mother. 
“ This is a raſh ſtep, certainly,“ ſaid 
the Confeſſor;““ but he is young, very 
young, and, therefore, does not foreſee the 


conſequence to which it leads. He docs | 


not perceive how ſeriouſly it will affect tha

lightly to reſign them, is to degrade him-

Unhappy young man ! he 1s to be pitied 
fully as much as blamed.” 

« Your excuſes, reverend father,“ ſaid 
the tortured Marcheſa, © prove the good- 
neſs of your heart; but they illuſtrate, 
allo, the degeneracy of lus mind, and detail 
the full extent of the effects which he has 
brought upon his family. It affords me 
no conſolation to know, that this degra- 
dation proceeds from his head, rather than 
his heart; it is ſuffleient that hg, has in- 
curred it, and that no poſſibility remains 


of throwing off the misfortune.“ 


“Perhaps that is aſfirming too much,“ 
obſerved Schedoni. 
« How father!“ {aid the Marchefa. 
Perhaps a poſſibility does remain,” 
he added. 
Point it out to me, good. father! I. 
do not perceive it.“

% Nay, my lady,” replied the ſubtle 
Schedoni, correcting himſelf,“ I am by no

exiſt, My ſolicitude for your tranquillity, |

me ſo unwilling to relinquiſh hope, that,

« Tt was cruel of you, father, to ſuggeſt | 
a hope which you could not juſtify,” ob- 


ſerved the Marcheſa. 


« You muſt accuſe my extreme folici- |

how 1s it poſſible for me to ſee a family of |

juſtly applied. And ſhall we ſubmit to 
this s it poſſible we can ſubmit to it?“ 

« There is no remedy,” ſaid Schedoni, 
coldly.

It is much to be lamented,” replied 
Schedoni.

the Marcheſa, deſerves a puniſhment

The Confeſſor bowed his head. 

I truſt that the ſervices you have ren- 
dered me, ſhall be gratefully repaid re- 
warded, I dare not hope, for what benefit 
could poſſibly reward a ſervice ſo vaſt, as it 
may, perhaps, be 1n your power to confer 
upon my family ! What recompence could 
be balanced againſt the benefit of having 
reſcued the honour of an ancient houſe !”? 

« Your goodneſs is beyond my thanks, 
or my deſert,” ſaid Schedoni, and he was 
again ſilent. 

The Marcheſa wiſhed him to lead her 
back to the point, from which ſhe herſelf 
had deviated, and he ſeemed determined, 
that ſhe ſhould lead him thither. She 
muſed, and heſitated. Her mind was not 
yet familiar with atrocious guilt ; and the 
crime which Schedoni had ſuggeſted, ſome- 
what alarmed her. She feared to think, 
and ſtill more to name it; yet, ſo acutely 


ſuſcep- 


( 114 ) 
ſuſceptible was her pride, ſo ſtern her in- 
dignation, and ſo profound her deſire of 
vengeance, that her mind was toſſed as on 
a tempeſtuous ocean, and theſe terrible 
feelings threatened to overwhelm the 
reſidue of humanity in her heart. Sche- 
doni obſerved all its progreſſive move- 
ments, and, like a gaunt tyger, lurked in 
ſilence, ready to ſpring forward at the mo- 
ment of opportunity. 

« It is you advice, then, father,“ re- 
ſumed the Marcheſa, after a long pauſe.— 
« it is your opinion that this Ellena.” — 
She heſitated, deſirous that Schedoni 
ſhould anticipate her meaning ; but he 
chole to ſpare his own delicacy rather than 
that of the Marcheſa.

girl deſerves“ She pauſed again, but

to be juſt. When the heart 1s warm, how 
is it poſſible that the judgment can be

with the ſilent footſtep, that indicates 
yarineſs and conſcious duplicity.

cowl, and ſhe knew him to be Schedoni. 

He inſtantly obſerved the agitation of 
her ſpirits, and that her purpoſe was not 
yet determined, according to his hope. 
But, though his mind became clouded, his 
countenance remained unaltered ; it was 
grave and thoughtful. The ſternneſs of 
his vulture-eye was, however, ſomewhat 
ſoftened, and its lids were contracted by 
ſubtlety. 

The Marcheſa bade her woman walk 
apart, while ſhe conferred with her Con- 


feſſor. 


„This unhappy boy,“ ſaid ſhe, when 


the attendant was at ſome diſtance, Ho 
much ſuffering does his folly inflict upon

„My daughter! can it be poſſible that

that his aſſiſtance was neceſſary to fix her 
fluctuating mind, gradually began to ſteal 
forth from the prudent reſerve, in which he 
had taken ſhelter. 

If this perſon was condemned by the

Schedoni, ſignificantly. 

The Marcheſa muſed ; for her con- 
ſcience allo was eloquent. She tried to 
overcome its voice, but it would be heard; 
and ſometimes ſuch ſtarts of horrible con- 
viction came over her mind, that ſhe felt 
as one who, awaking from a dream, opens 
his eyes only to meaſure the depth of the 
precipice on which he totters. In ſuch 
moments ſhe was aſtoniſhed, that ſhe had 
pauſed for an inftant upon a ſubje&amp; ſo 
terrible as that of murder. The ſophiſtry 
of the Confeſſor, together with the incon- 
ſiſtencies which he had betrayed, and 
which had not eſcaped the notice of the 
Marchefa, even at the time they were ut-

Aye, daughter, or why travel fo far as

it was more terrible than uſual, and over- 
ſpread with a dark, cadaverous hue of 
mingled anger and guilt. The Marcheſa 
ſtarted involuntarily as, paſſing by a win- 
dow, the evening gleam that fell there, diſ- 
covered it; and for the firſt time ſhe wiſh- 
ed, that ſhe had not committed herſelf fo 
wholly to his power. But the die was now 
caſt; it was too late to be prudent ; and 
ſhe again demanded his reaſons. 

« No matter,” ſaid Schedoni, in a a tafled 
voice“ ſhe dies!“ 

* By his hands?“ aſked the Marcheſa, 
with ſtrong emotion.“ Think, once more, 


father.“ 


Theywere both again ſilent and thought- 
ful. The Marcheſa, at length, ſaid,“ Fa- 
ther, I rely upon your integrity and pru- 
dence ;”* and ſhe laid a very flattering em- 
phaſis upon the word integrity. * But I 
conjure you to let this buſineſs be finiſhed 


quickly, ſuſpenſe is to me the purgatory

pliſhment of it to a ſecond perſon.” After 
a momentary pauſe ſhe added, I would 
not willingly owe ſo vaſt a debt of obliga- 
tion to any other than yourſelf.“ 

* Your requeſt, daughter, that I would 
not confide this buſineſs to a ſecond per- 
ſon,” ſaid Schedoni, with diſpleaſure, “ can- 
not be accorded to, Can you ſuppoſe, 
that I, myſelf” 

Can I doubt that principle may both 
prompt and perform the deed?” inter- 
rupted the Marcheſa with quickneſs, 
and anticipating his meaning, while ſhe 


retorted upon him his former words,— 


« Why ſhould we heſitate to do what we 
judge to be right?“ 

The ſilence of Schedoni alone indicated 
his diſpleaſure, which the Marcheſa imme- 
diately underſtanding— 

« Conſider, good father,” ſhe added 
ſignificantly, “ how painful it muſt be to 
me, to owe ſo infinite an obligation to 


a ftranger, or to any other than ſo highly 


valued a friend as yourſelf.“

Schedoni, while he detected her mean- 
ing, and perſuaded himſelf that he deſpiſ- 
ed the flattery, with which ſhe fo thinly 
veiled it, unconſciouſly ſuffered his {elf- 
love to be ſoothed by the compliment. 
He bowed his head, in ſignal of conſent to 
her wiſh. 

% Avoid violence, if that be poſſible,” 
ſhe added, immediately comprehending 
him, © but let her die quickly! The pu- 


niſhment is due to the crime.“ 


The Marche ſa happened, as ſhe ſaid this, 
to caſt her eyes upon the inſcription over 
a Confeſſional, where appeared, in black 
letters, theſe awful words, „ God hears 
thee !”” It appeared an awful warning. 
Her countenance changed; it had ſtruck 
upon her heart. Schedoni was too much | 


engaged by his own thoughts, to obſerve 


or underſtand her filence. She ſoon reco- Þ 
vered herſelf; and confidering that this 
was a common inſcription for Confeſ- 
ſionals, diſregarded what ſhe had at firlt ]

The organ ſounded faintly from the 
choir, and pauſed, as before. In the next 
moment, a ſlow chaunting of voices was 
heard, mingling with the riſing peal, in a 
ſtrain particularly melancholy and ſo- 
lemn. 

« Who is dead? ſaid rhe Marcheſa, 
changing conntenance; * 1t is a requiem!“ 

« Peace be with the departed !” ex- 
claimed Schedoni, and croſſed himſelf; 
« Peace reſt with his ſoul !” 

« Hark ! to that chaunt!ꝰ ſaid the Mar- 
cheſa, in a faltering voice; * it is a firſt 
requiem ; the ſoul has but juſt quitted 
the body!“ 

They liſtened in ſilence. The Marche- 
ſa was much affected; her complexion 
varied at every inſtant ; her breathings 
were ſhort and interrupted, and ſhe even 
ſhed a few tears, but they were thoſe of 
deſpair, rather than of ſorrow. That 
body is now cold,“ ſaid ſhe to herlelf, 
which but an hour ago was warm and 

animated!

death! And to this condition would I re- 


duce a being like myſelf ? Oh, wretched, 
wretched mother ! to what has the folly of

She turned from the Confeſſor, and 
walked alone in the cloiſter. Her agita- 
tion encreaſed; ſhe wept without reſtraint, 
for her veil and the evening gloom con- 
cealed her, and her fighs were loſt amudi! 
the muſic of the choir. 

Schedoni was ſcarcely Jeſs diſturbed, 
but his were emotions of apprehenſion and 
contempt. © Behold, what is woman! 
ſaid he! The ſlave of her paſſions, the 
dupe of her ſenſes! When pride and re- 
venge ſpeak in her breaſt, ſhe defies ob- 
ſtacles, and laughs at crimes! Aſſail but 
her ſenſes ; let muſic, for inſtance, touch 
ſome feeble chord of her heart, and echo 
to her fancy, and lo all her perceptions 
change: — ſhe ſhrinks from the act ſhe had

the Confeffor, bowing gravely, * You

yiclds t9 ſome new emotion, and finks— 
the victim of a ſound ! O, weak and con- 
temptible being!“ 

The Marchela, at leaſt, ſeemed to juſti- 
fy his obſervations. The deſperate paſ- 
ſions, which had reſiſted every remon- 
{trance of reaſon and humanity, were van- 
quiſhed only by other paſſions ; and, her 
ſenſes touched by the mournful melody of 
muſic, and her ſuperſtitious fears awaken- 
ed by the occurrence of a requiem tor the 
dead, at the very moment when the was 
planning murder, ſhe yielded, for a while, 
to the united inftuence of pity and terror. 
Her agitation did not ſubſide; but ſhe 
returned to the Confeſſor. 

* We will converſe on this buſineſs at 
ſome future time,” ſaid ſhe ; © at preſent, 


my ſpirits are diſordered. Good night, 


father! Remember me in your ori-

„„ Wo

The Marcheſa beckoned her woman to

and leaning upon the attendant's arm, ſhe 
left the cloiſter. Schedoni remained for 
a moment on the ſpot, looking after her, 
till her figure was loſt in the gloom of the 
long perſpective; he then, with thought- 
ful ſteps, quitted the cloiſter by another 
door. He was diſappointed, but he did 
not deſpair,

Win the Marcheſa and the Monk 
were thus meditating conſpiracies againſt 


Ellena, ſhe was ſtill in the Urſaline con- 
vent on the lake of Celano. In this ob- 
ſcure ſanctuary, indiſpoſition, the conſe- 
quence of the long and ſevere anxiety ſhe 
had ſuffered, compelled her to remain. A 
fever was on her ſpirits, and an univerſal 
laſſitude prevailed over her frame, which 
became the more effe&amp;ual, from her very 
lolicitude to conquer it. Every approach- 


ing 


( 140 
ing day ſhe hopcd ſhe ſhould be able ty 


purſue her journey homeward, yet every day 
found her as ineapable of travelling as the 
laſt, and the ſecond week was already gone, 
before the fine air of Celano, and the tran- 
quillity of her aſylum, began to revive her. 
Vivaldi, who was her daily viſiter at the 
grate of the convent ; and who, watching 
over her with intenſe ſolicitude, had hi- 
therto forbore to renew a ſubject, which, 
by agitating her ſpirits, might affe&amp; her 
health, now, that her health ſtrengthened, 
ventured gradually to mention his fears left 
the place of her retreat ſhould be diſco- 
vered, and leſt he yet might irrecoverably 
loſe her, unleſs ſhe would approve of their 
ſpeedy marriage. At every vifit he now 
urged the ſubject, repreſented the dangers 
that ſurrounded them, and repeated his ar- 
guments and entreaties ; for now, when 
he believed that time was preffing forward 
fatal evils, he could no longer attend to 
the delicate {cruples, that bade him be

„in 

ſparing in entreaty. Ellena, had ſhe obey- 
ed the dictates of her hcart, would have 
rewarded his attachment and his ſervices, 
by a frank approbation of his propoſal; 
but the objections which reaſon exhibited 
againſt ſuch a conceſſion, ſhe could neither 
overcome or diſregard. 

Vivaldi, after he had again repreſented 
their preſent dangers, and claimed the pro- 
miſe of her hand, received in the preſence 
of her deceaſed relative, Signora Bianchi, 
gently ventured to remind her, that an 
event as ſudden as lamentable, had firſt 
deferred their nuptials, and that if Bianchi 
had lived, Ellena would have beſtowed, 
long fince, the vows he now ſolicited. 
Again he intreated her, by every facred and 
tender recollection, to conclude the feartul 
uncertainty of theirfate, and to beſtowup- 
on him the right to protect her, before they 
ventured forth from this temporary aſylum. 

Ellena immediately admitted the ſacred- 
neſs of the promiſe, which ſhe had formerly 
3 given, 


| ( 142 } 

given, and aſſured Vivaldi that ſhe conſi- 
dered herſelf as indiſſolubly bound by that 
promiſe, as if it had been givenat the altar; 
but ſhe objected to a confirmation of it, 
till his family ſhould ſeem willing to ac- 
knowledge her for their daughter; when, 
forgetting the injuries ſhe had received 
from them, ſhe would no longer refuſe their 
alliance. Ellena added, that Vivaldi ought 
to be more jealous of the dignity of the 
woman, whom he honoured with his 
eſteem, than to permit her making a 
oreater conceſſion. 

Vivaldi felt the full force of this appeal; 
he recollected, with anguiſh, circum- 
ſtances of which ſhe was happily ignorant, 
but which ſerved to ſtrengthen with him 
the juſtneſs of her reproof. And, as the 
aſperſions which the Marcheſa had thrown 
upon her name, crowded to his memory, 
pride and indignation ſwelled his heart, 
and ſo farovercame all apprehenſion of ha- 
Zard, that he formed a momentary reſolu- 

ti0 


( 163 


tion to abandon every other conſideration, 


to that of aſſerting the reſpect which was 
due to Ellena, and to forbear claiming her 
| for his wife, till his family ſhould make 

* acknowledgment of their error, and wil- 

 lingly admit her in the rank of their child. 

But this reſolution was as tranſient as 
plauſible; other conſiderations, and for- 
mer fears, preſſed upon him. He per- 
ceived the ſtrong improbability, that they 
would ever make a voluntary ſacrifice of 
their pride to his love; or yield miſtakes, 
nurtured by prejudice and by willing indul- 
gence, to truth and a ſenſe of juſtice. In 
the mean time, the plans which would be 
formed for ſeparating him from Ellena, 
might ſucceed, and he ſhould loſe her for 
ever. Above all, it appeared, that the beſt, 
the only method which remained for con- 
tuting the daring aſperſions that had af- 
fected her name, was, by proving the high 
reſpect he himſelf felt for her, and preſent- 
ing her to the world in the ſacred charac- 
tes 


( 144 ) 
ter of his wife. Theſe conſideration: 
quickly determined him to perſevere in 
his ſuit; but it was impoſſible to urge 
them to Ellena, fince the facts they 


muſt untold, would not only ſhock her 


delicacy and afflict her heart, but would 
furniſh the proper pride ſhe cheriſhed, 
with new arguments againſt approach- 
ing a family who had thus groflly inſulted 
her. 

While theſe confiderations occupied 
him, the emotion they occaſioned did no 
eſcape Ellena's obſervation ; it encreaſed, 
as he reflected on the impoſſibility of urg- 
ing them to her, and on the hopeleſsneſ 
of prevailing with her, unleſs he could pro- 
duce new arguments in his favour. i: 
unaffected diſtreſs awakened all her 
tenderneſs; ſhe aſked herlelf, whether 
ſhe ought any longer to aſſert her own 
rights, when, by doing fo, ſhe facri- 
ficed the peace of him who had incur- 
red ſo much danger for her ſake, who ha! 

| relcued

[348-3 


reſcued her from ſevere oppreſſion, and had 
ſo long and ſo well proved the ſtreng;!: 
of his affection. 

As ſhe applied theſe queſtions, ſhe ap- 
peared to herſelf an unjuſt and ſelfiſh be- 
ing, unwilling to make any ſacrifice for the 
tranquillity of him, who had given her 
liberty, even at the riſk of his life, Her 
very virtues, now that they were carried 
to excefs, ſeemed to her to border upon 
vices ; her ſenſe of dignity, appeared to be 
narrow pride; her delicacy weakneſs; her 
moderated affeQton cold ingratitude ; and 
her circumſpection, little leſs than pru- 
dence degenerated into meanneſs. 

Vivaldi, as apt in admitting hope as fear, 
immediately perceived her reſolution be- 
ginning to yield, and he urged again every 
argument which was likely to prevail over 
it. But the ſubject was too important 
tor Ellena, to be immediately decided 
upon ; he departed with only a faint al- 
[urance of encour agement ; and the for- 

VOL, IL. 11 bade 


( 146 ) 
bade him to return till the following day, 
when che would acquaint him with her 
final determination, 

This interval was, perhaps, the moſt 
painful he had ever experienced. Alone, 
and on the banks of the lake, he paſſed 
raany hours in alternate hope and fear; 
in endeavouring to anticipate the deciſion, 
on which ſeemed ſuſpended all his future 
peace, and abruptly recoiling from it, as 
often as imagination repreſented it to be 
adverſe. | 

Of the walls that encloſed her, he 
ſcarcely ever loft fight ; the view of them 
ſeemed to cheriſh his hopes, and, while he 
gazed upon their rugged ſurface, Ellena 
alone was pictured on his fancy; till us 
anxiety to learn her diſpoſition towards him 
aroſe to agony, and he weuld abrutly leave 
the ſpot. But an inviſible ſpell ſtill ſeemed 
to attract him back again, and evening 
found him pacing ſlow ly beneath the ſhade 
of thoſe melancholy boundaries that cen- 
cealed his Ellena. 

Her 


„ 

Her day was not more tranquil, When- 
ever prudence and decorous pride forbade 
her to become a member of the Vivaldi 
family, as conſtantly did gratitude, affec- 
tion, irreſiſtible tenderneſs, plead the cauſe 
of Vivaldi. The memory of paſt times re- 
turned; and the veryaccents of the deceaſ- 
ed ſeemed to murmur from the grave, and 
command her to fulfil the engagement, 


s F which had ſoothed the dying moments of 
e Bianchi. | 

On the following morning, Vivaldi was 
\c at the gatcs of the convent, long betore the 
m appointed hour, and he lingered in tor- 
e turing impatience, till the clock ſtruck the 
na © fignal for his entrance. 
15 Ellena was already in the parlour; ſhe 
in vas alone, and roſe in diforder on his ap- 
we proach. His ſteps faltered, his voice was 


loſt, and his eyes only, which he fixed 
with earneſtneſs on her's, had power to 
enquire her reſolution. She obſerved the 
baleneſs of his countenance, and his emo- 
SH H 2 tion, 


FA AE es 


( 148 ) 

tion, with a mixture of concern and ap- 
probation. At that moment, he perceived 
her ſmile, and hold out her hand to him; 
and fear, care, and doubt, vaniſhed at once 
from his mind. He was incapable of 
thanking her, but ſighed deeply as he 
preſſed her hand, and, overcome with jon, 
ſupported himſelf againſt the grate that 
ſeparated them. 

« You are, then, indeed my own !”” ſaid 
Vivaldi, at length recovering bis voice— 
„We ſhall be no more parted-—you are 
mine for ever | But your countenance 
changes! O heaven! ſurely 1 have not 


miltaken ! Speak I conjure you, Ellen: ; 
relieve me from theſe terrible doubts !” 
„Jam yours, Vivaldi,“ replied Ellens 
faintly,** oppreſhon can part us no more.” 
She wept, and drew her veil over her 
eyes. | | 
«What mean thoſe tears ?” ſaid Vival- 


di, with alarm, © Ah! Ellena,“ he added 
in a ſoftened voice, © ſhould tears mingle 
with 


LT 


* 


( 149 ) 
with ſuch moments as theſe ! Should your 
tcars fall upon my heart now ! They tell 
me, that your conſent is given with reluc- 
tance—with grief; that your love is fee- 
ble, your beart —yes, Ellena ! that your 
whole heart is no longer mine!“ 

« They sught rather to tell you,“ 
plied Ellena, © that it is all your own; 
that my affection never was more powerful 
than now, when it can overcome every 
conſideration with reſpect to your family, 
and urge me to a ſtep which muſt degrade 
me in their eyes, —and, I fear, in my own.” 

“ O retract that cruel afſertion !” inter- 
rupted Vivaldi, * Degrade you in your 
own !—degrade you in their eyes !' He 
was much agitated ; his countenance was 
fuihed, and an air of more than uſual 
dignity dilated his figur e, while he added 
with energy, 

The time ſhall come, my Ellena, 
when they ſhallunderſtand your worth. 1 &amp;: 
acknowledge your excellence. C! that”

1 were an Emperor, that T might ſhew to 
all the world how much L love and honour 
you !” 

Ellena gave him her hand, and, with- 
drawing her veil, ſmiled on him through her 
tears, with gratitude and reviving courage, 
Before Vivaldi retired from the convent, 
he obtained her conſent to conſult with an 
aged Benedictine, whom he had engaged 
in his intereſt, as to the hour at which the 
marriage might be folemnized with leaſt 
obſervation. The prieſt informed him, 
that at the concluſion of the veſper- 
ſervice, he ſhould be diſengaged ; and 
that, as the firſt hour after ſun-ſet was 
more ſolitary than almoſt any other, the 
brotherhood being then aſſembled in the 
refectory, he would meet Vivaldi and El- 
lena at that time, in a chapel on the edge 
of the lake, a ſhort diſtance from the Bene: 


dictine convent, to which it belonged, 


and celebrate their nuptials. 


With, this propoſal, Vivaldi imme: | 
diately 


in) 
Gately returned to Ellena ; when it was 
agreed, that the party ſhould aſſemble at 
the hour mentioned by the prieſt. Ellena, 
who had thought it proper to mention her 
intention to the Abbeſs of the Urſalines, 
was, by her permiſſion, to be attended by a 
lay-fiſter; and Vivaldi was to meet her with- 
out the walls, and conduct her to the al- 
tar. When the ceremony was over, the 


© fugitives were to embark in a veſſel, hired 


for the purpoſe, and, croſſing the lake, pro- 
ceed. towards Naples. Vivaldi again with- 
drew to. engage a boat, and Ellena to 
prepare for the contiauance of her jour- 
ney. 

As the appointed hour drew near, her 


* ſpirits ſunk, and ſhe watched, with melan- 


choly foreboding, the ſun retiring amidſt 


ſtormy clouds, and his rays fading from the 


higheſt points of the mountains, till the 
gloom of twilight prevailed over the ſcene. 


She then left her apartment, took a

and, attended by the lay- ſiſter, quitted the 
convent. | 

Immediately without the gate ſhe was 
met by Vivaldi, whoſe look, as he put her 
arm within his, gently reproached her for 
the dejection of her air. 

They walked in ſilence towards the cha- 
pel of San Sebaſtian. The ſcene appeared 
to ſympathize with the ſpirits of Ellena, 
It was a gloomy evening, and the lake, 
which broke in dark waves upon the ſhore, 
mingled its hollow ſounds with thoſe of 
the wind, that bowed the lofty pines, and 
{wept in guſts among the rocks. She ob- 
ſerved with alarm the heavy thunder- 
clouds, that rolled along the fides of the 
mountains, and the birds circling fwiftly 


over the waters, and ſcudding away to. 


their neſts among the cliffs; and ſhe no- 
ticed to Vivaldi, that, as a ſtorm ſeemed 
approaching, ſhe wiſhed to avoid croſſing 
the lake. He immediately ordered Paulo 
to diſmiſs the boat, and to be in waiting 

7 with 


F 
with a carriage, that, if the weather ſhould 
become clear, they might not be detained 


longer than was otherwiſe neceſſary. 


As they approached the chapel, Ellena 
axed her eyes on the mournful cypreſſes 
which waved over it, and ſighed.“ Thoſe,” 
ſhe ſaid, are funereal mementos—not 
ſuch as ſhould grace the altar of marriage 
Vivaldi, I could be ſuperſtitious.— Think 
you not they are portentous of future mis- 
fortune ? But forgive me; my ſpirits are 
weak.“ 

Vivaldi endeavoured to ſoothe her mind, 
and tenderly reproached her for the ſadneſs: 
ſhe indulged. Thus they entered the. 
chapel. Silence, and a kind of gloomy ſe- 
pulchral light prevailed within. The ve- 
nerable Benedictine, with a brother, who 
was to ſerve as guardian to the bride, were 
Already there, but they were kneeling, and 
engaged 1n prayer. 

Vivaldi led the trembling Ellena to the 

Atar, where they waited till the Benedic--

eines ſhould have finiſhed, and theſe were 
moments of great emotion. She often 
looked round the duſky chapel, in fearful 
expectation of diſcovering ſome lurking 
obſerver; and, though ſhe knew it to be 
very improbable, that any perſon-in this 
neighbourhood:could be intereſted in in- 
terrupting the ceremony, her mind in- 
voluntarily admitted the poſſibility of it. 
Once, indeed, as her eyes glanced over a 
caſement, Ellena fancied ſhe diſtinguiſhed 
a human face laid cloſe to the glaſs, as if ts 
watch what was paſſing within; but when 
ſhe looked again, the apparition was gone: 
Notwithftanding this, .ſhe liſtened with 
anxiety to the uncertain. ſounds without, 
and ſometimes ſtarted as the ſurges of the 
lake daſhed over the rock below, almoſt 
believing ſhe heard the ſteps and whiſper- 
ing voices of men in the ayenues of the 
chapel. She tried, however, to ſubdue 
apprehenfion, by confidering, that if this 
were true, an harmleſs curioſity nught

have attracted ſome. inhabitants of the: 
convent hither, and her ſpirits became 
more compoled, till ſhe obſerved a door 
open a little way, and a dark countenance 
looking from behind it. In the next in- 
ſtant it retreated, and the door was cloſed. 

Vivaldi, who perceived Ellena's com- 
plexion change, as ſhe laid her hand on 
his arm, followed her eyes to the door, but, 
no perſon appearing, he enquired the 
cauſe of her alarm. 

We are obſerved,“ ſaid Ellena,“ ſome 
perſon appeared at that door !” 

And if we are obſerved, my love,“ re- 
plied Vivaldi, © whois there in this neigh- 
bourhood whoſe obſervation we can have. 
reaſon to fear? Good father, diſpatch, he 
added, turning to the prieſt, © you forget. 
that we are waiting.“ 

The officiating prieſt made a ſignal that 
tie had nearly concluded his oriſon; but 
tue other brother roſe immediately, and 
ſpoke with Vivaldi, who deſired.that the

temple,“ replied the Benedictine, “ it is a 
ſanctuary, and never may be cloſed.” 

Rut you will allow mei to repreſs idle 
curioſity,” ſaid Vivaldi, Ind to enquire 
who watches beyond that door? The 
tranquility: of this lady, demands thus 
much.” * 

The brother aſſented, and Vivaldi ſtep- 
ped to the door; but perceiving no perſon 
in the obſcure paſſage beyond it, he re- 
turned with lighter ſteps to the altar, 
from which the officiating prieſt now 
roſe. 

22 My children,” ſaid he, © I have made 
you waif— but an old man's prayers are 
not le important than a young man's 
yows, though this is not a moment when. 
you will admit that truth.“ 

« I will allow whatever you pleaſe, 
good father,” replied Vivaldi, © if you will

adminiſter thoſe. vows, without further» 
delay time preſſes.“ 
The venerable prieſt took his ſtation at. 
the altar, and opened the book. Vivaldi. 
placed himielt on his right hand, and with 
looks of anxious love, endeavoured to en- 
courage Ellena, who, with a dejected coun- 
tenance, which her veil but ill concealed, 
and eyes fixed on the ground, leaned on 
her attendant ſiſter. The figure and home- 
ly features of this ſiſter; the tall ſtature 
and harſh viſage of the brother, clothed in 
the gray habit of his order; the ſilvered 
head and placid phy ſiognomy of the offici- 
ating prieſt, enlightened by a gleam from 
the lamp above, oppoſed to the youthful 
grace and ſpirit of Vivaldi, and the milder 
beauty and ſweetneſs of Ellena, formed 
altogether a group worthy of the pencil. 
The prieſt had begun the ceremony, when 
a noiſe from without again alarmed Elle- 
na, who obſerved the door once more cau- 
|  tiouſly opened, and a man bend forward his 
gigantic- 


(rss. ) 
gigantic figure from behind it. Ele car- 
ried a torch, and its glare, as the door gra- 
dually uncloſed, diſcovered other perſons 
in the paſſage beyond, looking forward. 
over his ſhoulder into the. chapel. The 
flerceneſs of their air, and the ſtrange pe- 
culiarity.of their drets, inſtantly convinced, 
Ellena that they were not inhabitants of 
the Benedictine convent, but ſome terrible 
meſſengers of evil. Her half-ſtifled ſhrick 
alarmed Vivaldi, who caught. her beſore 
the fell to the ground; but, as he had not 
faced the door, he did not underſtand the 
occaſion of her terror, till the ſudden ruſh 
of footſteps made him turn, when he ob- 
ſerved ſeveral men armed, and very ſin- 
gularly habited, advancing towards the 
altar. 

«* Who is he that intrudes upon this 
ſanctuary?“ he demanded ſternly, while he 
kalf roſe from the ground where Ellena.

The prieſt and Vivaldi now ſpoke toge- 
ther, but the words of neither could be 


diſtinguiſhed, when a voice, tremendous. 
from its loudneſs, like burſting thunder, 


diſſipated the cloud of myſtery. 


«You, Vincentio di Vivaldi, and of Na- 
ples,” it ſaid, and you Ellena di Roſal- 
ba, of Villa Altieri, we ſummon you to ſur- 
render, in the name of the moſt holy In-

The official repeated the ſummons, 


without deigning to reply. 


Vivaldi, yet more, aſtoniſhed, added,

« You may believe what you pleaſe,

« Begone impoſtor!' ſaid Vivaldi, 
ſpringing from the ground, where he had 
ſupported Ellena, “or my {word ſhall teach

« Do you inſult an officer of the Inqui-

The prieſt interrupted Vivaldi's retort,

« Produce your form of ſummons,““ 
demanded Vivaldi, with haughty impa- 
tience. 

« It is here,” replied the official, draw- 
ing forth a black ſcroll, which he deli- 
vered to the prieſt, © Read, and be ſatis- 
fed !” 

The Benedlictine ſtarted the inſtant he 
beheld the ſcroll, but he received and de- 
liberately examined it. The kind of parch- 
ment, the impreſſion of the ſeal, the par- 
ticular form of words, the private fignals, 
underſtood only by the initiated—all ſeem- 
ed to announce this a true inſtrument of 
arreſtation from the Holy Office. The ſcroll. 
dropped from his hand, and he fixed his: 
eyes, with ſurprize and unutterable com- 
paſſion, upon Vivaldi, who ſtooped to 
reach the parchment, when it was ſnatch- 
ed by the official. 

* Unhappy young man!” ſaid the prieſt, 
&amp; it is too true; you are ſummoned by 
that awful power, to anſwer for your crime, 

and 


5 
and I am ſpared from the commiſſion of a 
terrible offence !”? | 

Vivaldi appeared thunderſtruck. “ For 
what crune, holy father, am I called upon 
to anſwer ? This is ſome bold and artful 
impoſture, ſince it can delude even you 
What crime? What offence?“ 

66] did not think you had been thus 
hardened in guilt!” replied the prieſt, 
« Forbear! add not the audacity of falſe- 
hood, to the headlong paſſions of youth, 
You underſtand too well your crime.” 

&amp; Falſchood !” retorted Vivaldi, © But 
your years, old man, and thoſe ſacred veſt- 
ments protect you. For theſe ruffians, 
who have dared. to implicate that inno- 
cent victim,“ pointing to Ellena, “ in the 
charge, they ſhall have juſtice from my 
vengeance.” 

„ Forbear ! forbear!“ ſaid the prieſt, 
ſeizing his arm, © have pity on yourſelf 
and on her. Know you not the puniſh- 
ment you incur from reſiſtance?“ 

«I know 


„ 

© I know nor care not,“ replied Vivaldi, 
« but I will defend Ellena di Roſalba to 
the laſt moment. Let them approach if 
they dare.” 

© It is on her, on her who lies ſenſeleſs 
at your feet, ſaid the pricſt, © that they 
will wreck their vengeance for theſe in- 
ſults; on her—the partner of your guilt.” 

“The partner of my guilt !”? exclaimed 
Vivaldi, with mingled aſtoniſnment and 
indignation of my guilt !”? 

* Raſh young man! does not the very 
veil ſhe wears betray it? I marvel how it 
could paſs my obſervation !'? 

«* You have ſtolen a nun from her con- 
vent,“ ſaid the chief officer, © and muſt 
anſwer for the crime. When you have 
wearied yourſelf with thele heroics, Signor, 
you muſt go with us; our patience is 
wearied already.“ 

Vivaldi obſerved, for the firſt time, that 
Ellena was ſhrouded in a nun's veil; it 
was the one which Olivia had lent, to con- 


ceal 


( 164 ) 
ccal her from the notice of the Abbes, 
on the night of her departure from San- 
Stefano, and which, in the hurry of that 
departure, ſhe had forgotten to leave with 


the recluſe. During this interval, her mind 
had been too entircly occupied by cares 
and apprehenſion to allow her once to no- 
tice, that the veil the wore was other than 
her uſual one; but it had been too well 
oblerved by ſome of the Urſaline ſiſters. 
Though he knew not how to account 
for the circumſtance of the veil, Vivaldi 
began to perceive others which gave co- 
tour to the charge brought againſt him, 
and to aſcertain the wide circumference of 
the ſnare that wes ſpread around him, 
He fancied, too, that he perceived the 
hand of Schedoni employed upon it, and 
that his dark ſpirit was now avenging 1t- 
ſelf for the expoſure he had ſuffered in the 
church of the Spirito Santo, and for all the 
conſequent mortifications. As Vivaldi 
was ignorant of the ambitious hopes which 


the 


(1053 

the Marcheſa had encouraged in father 
Schedoni, he did not ſee the improbabili- 
ty, that the Confeſſor would have dared to 
hazard her favour by this arreſt of her ſon; 
much leſs could he ſuſpect, that Schedoni, 
having done ſo, had ſecrets in his poſſeſ- 
fon, which enabled him ſafely to defy her 
reſentment, and bind her in ſilence to his 
decree. 

With the conviction, that Schedoni's 
was the maſter- hand that directed the pre- 
{ent manceuvre, Vivaldi ſtood aghaſt, and 
gar ing in ſilent unutterableanguiſh on El- 
lena, who, as ſhe began to revive, ſtretched 
forth her helpleſs hands, and called upon 
him to fave her, Do not leave me,” ſaid 
ſhe in accents the moſt ſupplicating, 1 
am ſafe while you are with me.“ | 

At the ſound of her voice, he ſtarted 
from his trance, and turning fiercely 
upon the ruffians, who ſtood in ſullen 
watchfulneſs around, bade them depart, 


or prepare for his fury. At the ſame in- 


ſtant 


„ 


ſtant they all drew their ſwords, and the 
ſhrieks of Ellena, and the ſupplicat ions of 
the officiating prieſt, were loſt amidſt the 
tumult of the combatants. 

Vivaldi, moſt unwilling to ſhed blood, 
ſtood merely on the defenſive, till the vio- 
lence of his antagoniſts compelled him to 
exert all his ſkill and ſtrength. He then 
diſabled one of the ruffians but his ſeill 
was inſufficient to repel the other two, and 
he was nearly overcome, when ſteps were 
beard approaching, and Paulo ruſhed into 
the chapel. Perceiving his maſter belct, 
he drew his ſword, and came furiouſly to 
his aid. He fought with unconquerabie 
audacity and fierceneſs, till nearly at the 
moment when his adverſary fell, other rut- 
fians entered the chapel, and Vivaldi, with 
bis faithful ſervant, was wounded, and, at 
length, diſarmed. 

Ellena, who had been withheld from 
throwing herſelf between the combatants, 
now, on obſerving that Vivaldi was woun- 


i 
6443 


( 167 ) 


ed, renewed her efforts for liberty, accom- 
panied by ſuch agony of ſupplication and 
complaint, as almoſt moved to pity the 
hearts of the ſurrounding ruffians. 
Diſabled by his wounds, and alſo held 
by his enemies, Vivaldi was compelled to 
witneſs her diſtreſs and danger, without a 
hope of reſcuing her. In frantic accents 
he called upon the old prieſt to protect 
her.

„Signor, it would have bcen well for

taken my advice ; you will pay dearly for

tian, who lay ſeverely wounded on the 
ground.

my arms were now at liberty, I would try

ſhe is, and not relent ! Can you, will you, 
barbarians ! drag her, allo, to deſtruc- 
tion, upon a charge too fo daringty

«* Our relent ing would be of no ſervice 
to her,” rephed the official, we muſt do 
our duty. Whether the charge is true ct 
falſe, ſhe muſt anſwer to it before ker 
judges.” 

* What charge?“ demanded Ellena. 

* The charge of having broken your 
nun's vow,“ replied the prieſt.

„She acknowledges no crime,” replied 
Vivaldi; “ ſhe only perceives the extent of

power! leave you for ever!“ 
VV The agony of this thought re- animated 
him with momentary ſtrepgth ; he burſt

The prieſt directed, that he ſhould be 
conveyed to the Benedictine convent, 
where his wounds might be examined, 
and medical aid adminiftered. The dif- 
abled ruffians were already carried thither 
but Vivaldi refuſed to go, unleſs Ellena

to the rules of the place, that a woman 
ſhould enter it, and before the prieſt could 
reply, his Benedictine brother eagerly ſaid, 
that they dared not tranſgreſs the law of 

the convent. 

Ellena's fears for Vivaldi entirely over- 
coming thoſe for herſelf, ſhe entreated, 
that he would ſuffer himſelf to be con- 
veyed to the Benedictines; but he could 
not be prevailed with to leave her. The

*« But waſte no more time,“ he added 
to his followers, and pointing to Ellena, 
„ away with her.” 

As he ſaid this, they lifted Elena in 
their arms. © Let me looſe!” cried Pau- 
lo, when he ſaw they were carrying her 
from the place, © let me loofe, I ſay ! and 
the violence of his ſtruggles burſt afunder 
the cords which held him; a vain releaſe, 
for he was inſtantly ſeized again. 

Vivaldi, already exhauſted by the loſs 
of blood and the anguiſh of his mind, 
made, however, a laſt effort to fave her; 
he tried to raiſe himſelf from the ground, 
but a ſudden film came over his ſight, and 
his ſenſes forſook him, while yet the name 
of Ellena faltered on his lips. 

As they bore her from the chapel, 
ſhe continued to call upon Vivaldi, and 
alternately to ſupplicate that ſhe mighr 
once more behold him, and take one laſt 
adieu. The ruffians were inexorable, and 
ſhe heard his voice no more, for he no

ſhe exclaimed, in the piercing accents of 
deſpair, © Farewell, Vivaldi! O! for ever

The tone, in which ſhe pronounced the 
laſt farewell!“ was ſo touching, that even 
the cold heart of the prieſt could not reſiſt 
it; but he impatiently wiped away the few 
tears, that ruſhed into his eyes, before they 
were obſerved. Vivaldi heard it—it ſeern- 
ed to arouſe him from death he heard 
her mournful voice for the laſt time, and, 
turning his eyes, ſaw her veil floating away 
through the portal of the chapel. All 
ſuffering, all effort, all reſiſtance was vain

CoLLIins's Ops to FEAR. 


'Fa B wounds of Vivaldi, and of his ſer- 
vant, were pronounced, by the Benedic- 
tine who had examined and dreſſed them, 
to be not dangerous, but thoſe of one of 
the ruffians were declared doubtful. Some 
few of the brothers diſplayed much com- 
poſton and kindneſs towards the priſon-

ers; but the greater part ſeemed fearful of 
expreſſing any degree of ſympathy for 
perſons who had fallen within the cogni- 
zance of the Holy Office, and even kept 
aloof from the chamber, in which they were 
confined. To this ſelf- reſtriction, how- 
ever, they were not long ſubjected ; for 
Vivaldi and Paulo were compelled to be- 
gin their journey, as ſoon as ſome ſhort reſt 
had ſufficiently revived them. They were 
placed in the ſame carriage, but the pre- 


ſence of two officers prevented all inter- 


change of conjecture as to the deſtination 
of Ellena, and with reſpect to the imme- 
diate occaſion of their misfortune. Paulo, 
indeed, now and then hazarded a ſurmiſe, 
and did not ſcruple to affirm, that the Ab- 
beſs of San Stefano was their chief enemy 
that the Carmelite friars, who had over- 
taken them on the road, were her agents ; 
and that, having traced their route, they 
had given intelligence where Vivaldi and 
Lllena might be found.

e gueſſed we never ſhould eſcape the 
'Abbeſs,” ſaid Paulo, though I would not 
diſturb you, Signor 10, nor the poor lady 
Elena, by ſaying ſo. But your Abbeſles 
are as cunning as Inquiſitors, and are ſo 
fond of governing, that they had rather, 
like them, ſend a man to the devil, than 
ſend him no where.” 

Vivaldi gave Paulo a ſignificant look, 
which was meant to repreſs his imprudent 
loquacity, and then funk again into ſilence 
and the abſtractions of deep grief. The offi- 
cers, mean while, never ſpoke, but were ob- 
feryant of all that Paulo faid, who per- 
ceived their watchfulneſs, but becauſe he 
deſpiſed them as ſpies, he thoughtleſsly de- 
ſpiſed them allo as enemies, and was ſo far 
from concealing opinions, which they 
might repeat to his prejudice, that he had 
a pride in exaggerating them, and in dar- 
ing the worſt, which the exaſperated tem- 
pers of theſe men, ſhut up in the ſame 
carriage with him, and compelled to hear

whatever he choſe to ſay againſt the inſti- 
tution to which they belonged, could 
effect. Whenever Vivaldi, recalled from 
his abſtractions by ſome bold aſſertion, 
endeavoured to check his imprudence, 
Paulo was contented to ſolace his con- 
ſcience, inſtead of protecting himſelf, by 
ſaying, © It is their own fault; they would 
thruſt themſelves into my company; let 
them have enough of it; and, if ever they 
take me before their reverences, the Inqui- 
ſitors, they ſhall have enough of it too. 
Iwill play up ſuch a tune in the Inquiſi- 
tion as is not heard there every day. 
I will jingle all the bells on their fool's 
caps, and tell them a little honeſt truth, if 
they. make me ſmart for it ever ſo.” 
Vivaldi, arouſed once more, and ſeriouſ- 
ly alarmed for the conſequences which ho- 
neſt Paulo might be drawing upon him- 
ſelf, now inſiſted on his filence, and was. 
obeyed. 
They travelled during the whole night,,

every poſt-houſe, Vivaldi looked for a car- 
riage that might incloſe Ellena, but none 
appeared, nor any found of wheels told 
him that ſhe followed. 

With the morning light he perceived 
the dome of St. Peter, appearing faintly 
over the plains that ſurround Rome, and 
he underſtood, for the firſt time, that he 
was going to the priſons of the Inquiſition 
in that city. The travellers deſcended 
upon the Campania, and then reſted for 
a few hours at a ſmall town on its borders. 

When they again ſet forward, Vivaldi 
perceived that the guard was changed, the 
officer who had remained with him in the 
apartment of the inn only appearing 
among the new faces which ſurrounded 
him. The drefs and manners of theſe men 
differed conſiderably from thoſe of the 
other. Their conduct was more tempe- 
rate, but their countenances expreſſed a 
darker cruelty, mingled with a ſly demure- 
neſs, and a ſolemn ſelf-importance, that an- 
nounced them at once as belonging to the 

Inquiſition.

Inquiſition. They were almoſt invariably 
filent ; and when they did ſpeak, it was 
only in a few ſententious words. To the 
abounding queſtions of Paulo, and the few 
earneſt entreaties of his maſter, to be in- 
formed of the place of Ellena's deſtination, 
they made not the leaſt reply; and liſten- 
ed to all the flouriſhing ſpeeches of the 
ſervant againſt Inquiſitors and the Holy 
Office, with the moſt profound gravity. 
Vivaldi was ſtruck with the circum- 
ſtance of the guard being changed, and 
ſtill more with the appearance of the par- 
ty, who now compoled it. When he com- 
pared the manners of the late, with thoſe 
of the preſent guard, he thought he diſco- 
vered in the firſt the mere ferocity of rut- 
fans; ; but in the latter, the principles of 
cunning and cruelty, which ſeemed parti- 
cularly to characterize Inquiſitors; he was 
inclined to believe, that a ſtratagem had 
enthralled him, and that now, for the firſt 
time, he was in the cuſtody of the Holy 


Office.

It was near midnight when the priſoners 
entered the. Porto de! Popolo, and found 
themſelves in the midſt of the Carnival at 
Rome. The Corſo, through which they 
were obliged to paſs, was crowded with gay 
carriages and maſks, with proceſſions of 
muſicians, monks, and mountebanks; was 
lighted up with innumerable tapers and 
flambeaux, and reſounded with the hete- 
rogeneous rattling of wheels, the muſic of 
ſerenaders, and thejokesandlaughterof the 
revellers, as they ſportively threw about 
theirſugar-plumbs. The heat of theweather 
made it neceſſary to have the windows of 


the coach open; and the priſoners, there- 


fore, ſaw all that paſſed without. It was 
a ſcene, which contraſted cruelly with the 
feelings and circumſtances of Vivaldi; 
torn as he was from her he moſt loved, in 
dreadtu] uncertainty as to her fate, and 
himſelf about to be brought before a tri- 
bunal, whoſe myſterious and terrible pro- 
ceedings appalled even the braveſt ſpirits. 

Altogether,

Altogether, this was one of the moſt ſtrik- 
ing examples, which the chequer-work of 


human life could ſhew, or human feelings 


endure. Vivaldi ſickened as he looked upon 
the ſplendid crowd, while the carriage 
made its way ſlowly with it; but Paulo, 
as he gazed, was reminded of the Corſo of 


Naples, ſuch as it appeared at the time of 


Carnival, and, comparing the preſent ſcens 
with his native one, he found fault with 
every thing he beheld. The dreſſes were 
taſteleſs, the equipages without ſplendor, 
the people without ſpirit; yet, ſuch was 
the propenſity of his heart to ſympathize 
with whatever was gay, that for ſome mo- 
ments, he forgot that he was a priſoner on 
his way to the Inquiſition; almoſt forgot 
that he was a Neapolitan; and, while he 
exclaimed againſt the dullneſs of a Roman 
Carnival, would have ſprung through the 


carriage window to partake of its ſpirit, if 


his fetters and his wounds had not withe 
held um. A deep figh from Vivaldi re-

At that moment they paſſed the theatre 
of San Carlo, the doors of which were 
thronged with equipages, where Roman 
ladies, in their gala habits, courtiers in 
their fantaſtic drefles, and maſks of all de- 
ſcriptions, were haſtening to the opera. In 
the midſt of this gay buſtle, where the car- 
riage was unable to proceed, the officials 
of the Inquiſition looked on in ſolemn 
filence, not a muſcle of their features re- 
laxing in ſympathy, or yielding a fingle 
wrinkle of the ſelf-importance that lifted 
their br8ws; and, while they regarded 
with ſecret contempt thoſe, who could be

without feeling a melancholy awe, a {a-

his own misfortunes preſſed too heavily 
upon him to be long unfelt, and his en- 

thuſiaſm vaniſhed like the moonlight. 
Arxeturninggleam lighted up, ſoon after, 
the rude and extenſive area, which the car-

deſolation, and the ruins ſcattered diſtant-

entirely abandoned by the modern inhabi- 
tants to the remains of its former grandeur. 
Not one ſhadow of a human being croſſed

which might be ſuppoſed to ſhelter an inha- 
bitant. The deep tone of a bell, however, 
rolling on the ſilence of the night, an- 
nounced the haunts of man to be not far off; 
and Vivaldi then perceived in the diſtance,

lofty walls and towers, that, as far as the 
gloom would permit his eye to penetrate, 
bounded the horizon. He judged thele 
to be the priſons of the Inquiſition. Pau- 
lo pointed them out at the ſame moment. 
„Ah, Signor!“ {ſaid hedeſpondingly, © that

He concluded with a deep ſigh, and

Corſo. 
The carriage having reached the walls, 


followed their bendings to a confiderable 
extent. Theſe walls, of immenſe height, 
and ſtrengthened by innumerable maſſy 


bulwarks, exhibited neither window or

The priſoners paſſed what ſeemed to be 
the principal entrance, from the grandeur 
of its portal, and the gigantic loftineſs of 
the towers that roſe over it; and ſoon af. 
ter the carriage ſtopped at an arch- way in 
the walls, ſtrongly barricadoed. One of 
the eſcort alighted, and, having ſtruck up- 
on the bars, a folding door within was im- 
mediately opened, and a man bearing a 
torch appeared behind the barricado, 
whoſe countenance, as he looked through 
it, might have been copied for the 

« Grim-viſaged comfortleſs Deſpair” 
of the Poet. 

No words were exchanged between him 
and the guard; but on perceiving who 
were without, he opened the iron gate, 
and the priſoners, having alighted, paſſed 
with the two officials beneath the arch, 
the guard following with a torch. They 
deſcended a flight of broad ſteps, at the 
foot of which another iron gate admitted 
them to a kind of hall; ſuch, however, it

at firſt appeared to Vivaldi, as his eyes 
4 glanced through its gloomy extent, im- 
perfectly aſcertaining it by the lamp, which 
hung from the centre of the roof. No 
4 perſon appeared, and a death-like filence 
E prevailed; for neither the officials nor the 
guard yet ſpoke; nor did any diſtant 
E ſound contradict the notion, which ſoon 
| | occurred, that they were traverſing the 
E chambers of the dead. To Vivaldi it 
appeared, that this was one of the bu- 
© rial vaults of the victims, who ſuffered 
in the Inquiſition, and his whole frame 
E thrilled with horror. Several avenues, 
q opening from the apartment, ſeemed to 
lead to diſtant quarters of this immenſe 
fabric, but ſtill no footſtep whiſpering 
; along the pavement, or voice murmuring 
through the arched roofs, indicated it to 
be the reſidence of the living.

was a member of this dreadful tribunal. 
The ſound of footſteps ſeemed to reach 
the ſtranger, for he turned, and pauſ- 
ed, while the officers advanced. They 
then made ſigns to each other, and ex- 
changed a few words, which neither Vi- 
valdi or his ſervant could underſtand, 
when the ſtranger, pointing with his taper 
along another avenue, paſſed away. Vi- 
valdi followed him with his eyes, till adoor 
at the extremity of the paſſage opened, 
and he ſaw the Inquiſitor enter an apart- 
ment, whence a great light proceeded, and 
where ſeveral other figures, habited like 
himſelf, appeared waiting to receive him. 
The door immediately cloſed; and, whe- 
ther the imagination of Vivaldi was at- 
fected, or that the ſounds were real, he 
thought, as it cloſed, he diſtinguiſhed 
half-ſtifled groans, as of a perſon in agony. 
The avenue, through which the pri- 
foners paſſed, opened, at length, into an

was ſupported by arches, and long arcades

black robes, iſlued, from time to time, from 
the paſſages, and croſſed the hall to other 7 


avenues. They eyed the priſoners with i | | 


curioſity, but without-pity. Their viſages, 
with few exceptions, ſeemed ſtamped with 
the characters of demons. Vivaldi could 


not look upon the grave cruelty, or the 
ferocious impatience, their countenance | 
ſeverally expreſſed, without reading in 


them the fate of ſome fellow-creature, 
the fate, which theſe men ſeemed going, 

even at this moment, to confirm; and, 2 
they paſſed with ſoundleſs ſteps, he ſhrunk 
from obſervation, as if their very looks 
poſſeſſed ſome ſupernatural power, and 
could have ſtruck death. But he followed 
their fleeting figures, as they proceeded on 
their work of horror, to where the laſt 
glimmering ray faded into darkneſs, ex. 
pecting to ſee other doors of other cham- 
bers open to receive them. While medi- 
tating upon theſe horrors, Vivaldi loſt 


every ſelfiſh conſideration in aſtoniſhment 
| and 


| ( 191 ) 
and indignation of the ſufferings; which 
the frenzied wickedneſs of man prepares 
i Kor man, who, even at the moment of in- 
fliction, inſults his victim with aſſertions of 
the juſtice and neceſſity of ſuch procedure. 
* Is this poſſible?” ſaid Vivaldi internally, 
1 Can this be in human nature — Can 
ſuch horrible perverſion of right be per- 
mitted! Can man, who calls himſelf en- 
dowed with reaſon, and immeaſurably ſu- 
perior to every other created being, argue 
himſelf into the commiſſion of ſuch horri- 


* 


Fr ble folly, ſuch inveterate cruelty, as exceeds 
tk all the acts of the moſt irrational and fero- 
4 kious brute. Brutes do not deliberately 
; | laughter their ſpecies; it remains for man 
be only, man, proud of his prerogative of rea- 
bon, and boaſting of his ſenſe of juſtice, 
ait WE : : 

* to unite the moſt terrible extremes of 
i Jolly and wickedneſs !” 

FP | Vivaldi had been no ſtranger to the ex- 
oft aſtence of this tribunal ; he had long un- 


Eeritood the nature of the eſtabliſhment, 
: and 


( 192 ) 
and had often received particular accounts 
of its cuſtoms and laws ; but, though he 
had believed before, it was now only that 
conviction appeared to impreſs his under. 
ſtanding. A new view of human nature 
ſeemed to burſt, at once, upon his mind, 
and he could not have experienced greater 
aſtoniſhment, if this had been the firſt 
moment, in which he had heard of the in- 
ſtitution. But, when he thought of Elle- 
na, conſidered that ſne was in the power 
of this tribunal, and that it was probable 
ſhe was at this moment within the ſame 
dreadful walls, grief, indignation, and de- 
ſpair, irritated him almoſt to frenzy. He 
ſeemed ſuddenly animated with ſuperna- 
tural ſtrength, and ready to attempt im- 
poſſibilities for her deliverance. It was by 
a ſtrong effort of ſelf command, that he 
forbore burſting the bonds which held 
him, and making a deſperate attempt to 
ſeek her through the vaſt extent of theſe 
priſons. Reflection, however, had no! 0

entitely forſaken him, but that he ſaw the 
impoſſibility of ſucceeding in ſuch an ef- 
fort, the moment he had conceived it, and 
he forbore to ruſh upon the certain de- 
ſtruction, to which it muſt have led. His 
paſſions, thus reſtrained, ſeemed to become 
virtues, and to diſplay themſelves in the 
energy of his courage and his fortitude. 
His ſoul became ſtern and vigorous in 
deſpair, and his manner and countenance 
aſſumed a calm dignity, which awed, in 


ſome degree, even his guards. The 
pain of his wounds was no longer felt ; it 


appeared as if the ſtrength of his intellec- 


tual ſelf had ſubdued the infirmities of 
the body, and, perhaps, in theſe moments 
of elevation, he could have endured the 
torture without ſhrinking. 

Paulo, meanwhile, mute and grave, was 
watchful of all that paſſed ; he obſerved 
the revolutions in his maſter's mind, with 
grief firſt, and then with ſurprize, but he 
could not imitate the noble fortitude, which 


now gave weight and ſteadineſs to Vivaldi's

thoughts. And when he looked on the 
power and gloom around him, and on the 
viſages of the paſſing Inquiſitors, he began 
to repent, that he had ſo freely delivered 
his opinion of this tribunal, in the pre- 
ſence of its agents, and to perceive, that 
if he played up the kind of tune he had 
threatened, it would probably be the laſt 
he ſhould ever be permitted to perform in 


this world. 


At length, the chief officer deſcended ths 
ſtair-caſe, and immediately bade Vivaldi 
follow him. Paulo was accompanying 
his maſter, but was withheld by the guard, 
and told he was to be diſpoſed of in a dit- 
ferent way. This was the moment of his 
{evereſt trial; he declared he would not 
be ſeparated from his maſter. 

What did 1 demand to be brought 
here for,“ he cried, “ if it was not that | 
might go ſhares with the Signor in all his 
troubles ? This is not a place to come te 


for pleaſure, I warrant; and I can promile 


Yes

ye, gentlemen, I would not have come 
within an hundred miles of you, if it had 
not been for my maſter's ſake.” 

The guards roughly interrupted him, 
and were carrying him away, when Vival- 
di's commanding voice arreſted them, 
He returned to ſpeak a few words of con- 
ſolation to his faithful ſervant, and, ſince 
they were to be ſeparated, to take leave or 
him. 

Paulo embraced his knees, and, while 
he wept, and his words were almolt ſtifled 
by ſobs, declared no force ſhould drag 
him from his maſter, while he had life; 


and repeatedly appealed to the guards, 


with—*&lt; What did I demand to be 
brought here for? Did ever any body 
come here to ſeek picature ? What right 
have you to prevent my going ſhares with 
my maſter in his troubles ?” 

We do not intend to deny you that 


pleaſure, friend,” replied one of the guards 


Don't you Then heaven bleſs you!“

cried Paulo, ſpringing from his knees, and 


ſhaking the man by the hand with a vio- 
lence, that would nearly have diſlocated 


the ſhoulder of a perſon leſs robuſt. 


“ So come with us,” added the guard, 
drawing him away from Vivaldi. Paulo 
now became outrageous, and, ſtruggling 
with the guards, burſt from them, and 
again fell at the feet of his maſter, who 
raiſed and embraced him, endeayouring 
to prevail with him to ſubmit quietly to 
what was inevitable, and to encourage him 
with hope. 

J truſt that our ſeparation will be 
ſhort,” ſaid Vivaldi, „and that we ſhall 
meet in happier circumſtances. My 
innocence mult ſoon appear.” 


*« We ſhall never, never meet again, 
Signor mio, in this world,” ſaid Paulo, ſob- 
bing violently, “ ſo don't make me hope 
ſo. That old Abbeſs knows what ſhe 15 
about too well to let us eſcape, or ſhe 
would not have catched us up ſo cunningly 

as 


6 19 


45 ſhe did; fo what ſignifies innocence ! 
O! if my old lord, the Marcheſe, did but 
know where we are!“ 

Vivaldi interrupted him, and, turning to 
the guards ſaid, © I recommend my faith- 
ful ſervant to your compaſſion ; he is inno- 
cent. It will ſome time, perhaps, be in 
my power to recompence you for any in- 
dulgence you may allow him, and I ſhall 
value it a thouſand times more highly, 
than any you could ſhew to myſelf! Fare- 
well, Paulo, farewell! Officer, I am 


ready.“ 


« Oſtay! Signor, for one moment 
ſtay!“ ſaid Paulo. 
« We can wait no longer,“ ſaid the 


guard, and again drew Paulo away, who 


looking piteouſly after Vivaldi, alternately 
repeated, Farewell, dear maeſtro! farewell, 
dear, dear maeſtro !”* and © What did I 
demand to be brought here for ? What 
did I demand to be brought here for ?— 
what was it for, if not to goſhares with my

maeſtro ?” till Vivaldi was beyond the 
reach of ſight and of hearing. 

Vivaldi, having followed the officer up 
the ſtair-caſe, paſſed through a gallery to 
an anti-chamber, where, being delivered 
into the cuſtody of ſome perſons in wait- 
ing, his conductor diſappeared beyond a 
folding door, that led to an inner apart- 
ment. Over this door was an inſcription in 
Hebrew characters, traced in blood-colour. 
Dante's inſcription on the entrance of the 
infernal regions, would have been ſuitable to 
a place, where every circumſtance and fea- 
ture ſeemed to ſay, Hope, that comes to 
al, comes not here!“ 

Vivaldi conjectured, that in this cham- 
ber they were preparing for lum the in- 
ſtruments, which were to extort a confel- 
tion ; and though he knew little of the re- 
gular proceedings of this tribunal, he had 
always underſtood, that the torture was 
inſlicted upon the accuſed perſon, till he 
made confeſſion of the crime, of which he 
was ſuſpected. By ſuch a mode of pro- 

ceeding, 


( 199 ) 

ceeding, the innocent were certain of ſuſ- 
fering longer than the guilty ; for, as they 
had nothing to confeſs, the Inquiſitor, 
miſtaking innocence for obſtinacy, perſe- 
vered in his inflictions, and it frequently 
happened that he compelled the innocent 
to become criminal, and aſſert a fal{zhood, 
that they might be relcaſcd from an— 
guiſh, wiluch they could no longer ſuſtain. 
Vivaldi conſidered this circumſtance un- 
dauntedly; every faculty of his ſoul was 
bent up to firmneſs and endurance. He 
believed that he underſtood tlie extent of 
the charge, which would be brought 
againſt him, a charge as falſe, as a ſpecious 
confirmation of it, would be terrible in its 
conſequence both to Ellena and himſelf. 
Yet every art would be practiſed to bring 
him to an acknowledgment of having car- 
ried off a nun, and he knew allo, that, 
fince the proſecutor and the witneſſes are 
never confronted with the priſoner in caſes 
of ſevere accuſation, and fince their very 

K 4 names 


( 200) 


names are concealed from him, it would 
he ſcarcely poſſible for him to prove hi: 
innocence. But he did not heſitate an 
inſtant whether to ſacrifice himſelf for 
Ellena, determining rather to expire be- 
neath the mercileſs inflictions of the In- 
quiſitors, than to aſſert a falſehood, which 
muſt involve her in deſtruction. 

The officer, at length, appeared, and, 
having beckoned Vivaldi to advance, un- 
covered his head, and bared his arms. He 
ther led him forward through the folding 
door into the chamber; having done 
which, he immediately withdrew, and the 
door, which ſhut out Hope, cloſed after 
him. 

Vivaldi found himſelf in a ſpacious 
apartment, where only two perſons were 
viſible, who were ſeated at a large table, 
that occupied the centre of the room. 
They were both habited in black; the one, 
who ſeemed by his piercing eye, and ex- 
traordinary phy ſiognomy, to be an Inqui- 
ſitor, 


( 201) 

ftor, wore on his head a kind of black 
turban, which heightened the natural fe- 
rocity of his viſage; the other was unco- 
vered, and his arms bared to the elbows. 
A book, with ſome inſtruments of ſingular 
appearance, lay before him. Round the 
table were ſeveral unoccupied chairs, on 
the backs of which appeared figurative 
ſigns; at the upper end of the apart- 
ment, a gigantic crucifix ſtretched nearly 
to the vaulted roof; and, at the lower end, 
ſuſpended from an arch in the wall, was a 
dark curtain, but whether 1t veiled a win- 
dow, or ſhrowded ſome object or perſon, 
neceſſary to the deſigns of the Inquiſitor, 
there were little means of judging. It was, 
however, ſuſpended from an arch ſuch as 
ſometimes contains a calement, or leads to 
a deep receſs. 

The Inquiſitor called on Vivaldi to ad- 
vance, and, when he had reached the ta- 
ble, put a book into his hands, and bade 
him ſwear to reveal the truth, and keep 

K 5 for 


$8 - wy 


for ever ſecret whatever he might ſee or 
hear 1n the apartment. 

Vivaldi heſitated to obey ſo unqualified 
a command. The Inquiſitor reminded 
him, by a look, not to be miſtaken, that 
he was abſolute here; but Vivaldi {till he- 
fitated. © Shall I conſent to my own 
condemnation ?” ſaid he to himſelf, The 
malice of demons like theſe may convert 
the moſtinnocent circumſtances into mat- 
ter of accuſation for my deſtruction, and 


I muſt anſwer whatever queſtions they 
chooſe to aſk. And ſhall I ſwear, alſo, to 


conceal whatever I may witneſs in this 


chamber, when I know that the moſt dia- 
bolical cruelties are hourly practiſed here?” 
The Inquiſitor, 1n a voice which would 
have made a heart leſs fortified than was 
Vivaldi's tremble, again commanded him 
to ſwear; at the ſame time, he made a 
ſignal to the perſon who ſat at the oppo- 
ſite end of the table, and who appeared to 

be an inferior officer. 
Vivald:

Vivaldi was ſtill ſilent, but he began to 
conſider that, unconſcious as he was of 
crime, it was ſcarcely poſſible for his words 
to be tortured into a ſelf- accuſation; and 
that, whatever he might witneſs, no retri- 
bution would be prevented, no evil with- 
held, by the oath which bound him to 
ſecreſy, ſince his molt ſevere denunciation 
could avail nothing againſt the ſupreme 
As he did not

imagination. As he accidentally threw

obſerved before without emotion, and 
now thought it moved, he almoſt ſtarted 
in expectation of ſeeing ſome perſon, an 
Inquiſitor, perhaps, as terrific as the one 
before him, or an Accuſer as malicious as 
Schedoni, ſteal from behind it. 

The Inquiſitor having adminiſtered the 
oath, and the attendant having noted it in 
his book, the examination began. After 
demanding, as is uſual, the names and 
titles of Vivaldi and his family, and his 
place of reſidence, to which he fully re- 
plied, the Inquiſitor aſked, whether he 
underſtood the nature of the accuſation 
on which he had been arreſted.

fitor, “ and remember your oath, What

A faint degree of ſurpriſe appeared on

moment, and making a ſignal to the Se- 
cretary, who immediately noted Vivaldi's 
words. 


« I ſolemnly deny it,“ replied Vivaldi, 
„ the accuſation is falle and mali-

Remember the oath you have taken !** 
repeated the Inquiſitor, © learn alſo, that

feſſion; but that the torture is applied to

“If you torture me, till J acknowledge 
the juſtneſs of this accuſation,” ſaid Vi- 
yvaldi, © I muſt expire under your inflic- 
tions, for ſuffering never ſhall compel me 
to aſſert a falſehold. It is not the truth,

« Recollect yourſelf,” ſaid the Inquiſi- 
tor, ſternly. © You are not brought hi- 
ther to accuſe, but to anſwer accuſation. 
You ſay you are innocent; yet acknow- 
ledge yourſelf to be acquainted with

know this, but from the voice of con- 
{cience ?” 

„From the words of your own ſum- 
mons,” replied Vivaldi, “and from thoſe 
of your officials who arreſted me.” 

« How!” exclaimed the Inquiſitor, 
« note that,” pointing to the Secretary; 
« he ſays by the words of our ſummons ; 
now we know, that you never read that 
ſummons. He ſays alſo by the words of 
our officials; it appears, then, he is igno- 
rant, that death would follow ſuch a breach 
of confidence.”

I never afferted I did; the friar, who read 
it, told of what it accuſed me, and your 
officials confirmed the teſtimony.” 

No more of this equivocation !” ſaid 
the Inquiſitor, © Speak only to the queſ- 
tion.” 

I will not ſuffer my affertions to be 
miſrepreſented,” replied Vivaldi, © or my 
words to be perverted againſt myſelf. I 
have ſworn to ſpeak the truth only ; fince 
you believe I violate my oath, and doubt

at the village of Legano, on the high road 
between Celano and Rome?“ 

Vivaldi, while he confirmed his afler- 
tion, recollected with ſome ſurprize that 
Legano was the place where the guard 
had been changed, and he mentioned the 
circumſtance. The Inquiſitor, however, 
proceeded in his queſtions, without ap- 
pearing to notice it. Was any perſon 
arreſted with you?“ | 

| « You 


( 209 ) 
ou cannot be ignorant,“ replied Vi- 
&amp; yaldi, © that Signora di Roſalba, was 
ſeized at the ſame time, upon the falle 
charge of being a nun, who had broken 
her vows, and eloped from her convent ; 
nor that Paulo Mendrico, my faithful 
ſervant | was alſo made a priſoner, though 
upon what pretence he was arreſted I am 
E utterly ignorant.“ 
The Inquiſitor remained for ſome mo- 
ments in thoughtful filence, and then 
enquired flightly concerning the family of 
Ellena, and her uſual place of reſidence. 
Vivaldi, fearful of making ſome affertion 
that might be prejudicial to her, referred 
him to herſelf; but the inquiry was 
repeated. 

„ She is now within theſe walls,” re- 
plied Vivaldi, hoping to learn from the 
manner of his examiner, whether his fears 
nere juſt, © and can anſwer theſe queſtions 
better than myſelf.“ 

The Inquifitor merely bade the Notary 

write:

for a few moments meditating. At length, 
he ſaid, © Do you know where you no 
are? 

Vivaldi, ſmilingat the queſtion, replied, 
« I underſtand that I am in the priſons of 
the Inquitition, at Rome.“ 

Do you know what are the crimes 
that ſubject perſons to the cognizance of 
the Holy Office?“ 

Vivaldi was ſilent. 

« Your conſcience informs you, and your 
ſilence confirms me. Let me admoniſh 
you, once more, to make a full confeſſion 
of your guilt ; remember that this 1s a 
mercitul tribunal, and ſhews favour to 
ſuch as acknowledge their crimes ?” 

Vivaldi ſmiled farcaſtically ; the Inqui- 
fitor proceeded. 

It does not reſemble ſome ſevere, yet 
juſt courts, where immediate execution 
follows the confeſſion of a criminal. No! 
it is merciful, and though it puniſhes 

guilt,

caſes of neceſſity, when the? obſtinate ſi- 
lence of the priſoner requires ſuch a mea- 
ſure, You lee, therefore, what you may 
avoid, and what expect.“ 

But if the priſoner has nothing to 
conſeſs ? faid Vivaldi,. —“ Can your tor- 
tures make him guilty? They may indeed 
force a weak mind to be guilty of falſe- 
hood; and to eſcape preſent anguiſh, a man 
may unwarily condemn himſelf to the 
death! But you ſhall find that I am not 
ſuch an one.“ 

«* Young man,” rephed the Inquiſitor, 
* you will underſtand too ſoon, that we 
never act but upon ſure authority; and 
will with, too late, that you had made an 
honeſt confeſſion. Your ſilence cannot 
keep from us a knowledge of your of- 
tences ; we are in poſſeſſion of facts; and 
your obſtinacy can neither wreſt from us 


the truth, or pervert it. Your molt ſe- 
cret offences are already written on the

Tremble, therefore, and revere. But un- 
derſtand, that though we have ſufficient 
proof of your guilt, we require you to 
confeſs ; and that the puniſhment of ob- 
ſtinacy is as certain, as that of any other 
offence.“ 

Vivaldi made no reply, and the Inqui- 
ſitor, after a momentary ſilence, added, 
« Was you ever in the church of the Spi- 
rito Santo, at Naples?“ 

« Before I anſwer the queſtion,” ſaid 
Vivaldi, © I require the name of my ac- 
cuſer.“ 

* You are to recollect that you have no 
right to demand any thing in this place,” 
obſerved the Inquiſitor, * nor can you be 
ignorant that the name of the Informer 1s 
always kept ſacred from the knowledge of 
the Accuſed. Who would venture to do 
his duty, if his name was arbitrarily to be 
expoled to the vengeance of the criminal 
againſt wliom he informs? It is only in a 

particular 


(823 5) 


particular proceſs that the Accuſer is 
brought forward.“ 

« The names of the Witneſſes?“ de- 
manded Vivaldi. © The ſame juſtice con- 
ceals them alſo from the knowledge of the 
Acculed,” replied the Inquiſitor. 

« And 1s no juſtice left for the Ac- 
cuſed ?” ſaid Vivaldi. © Is he to be tried 
and condemned without being confront- 
ed with either his Proſecutor, or the 
Witneſſes?“ 

« Your queſtions are too many,“ ſaid 
the Inquiſitor, © and your anſwers too few. 
The Informer is not alſo the Proſecutor ; 
the Holy Office, before which the inform- 
ation is laid, is the Proſecutor, and the 
diſpenſer of juſtice ;z its Public Accuſer 
lays the circumſtances, and the teſtimonies 
of the Witnefles, before the Court. But 
too much of this.” 

« How !” exclaimed Vivaldi, © is the 
tribunal at once the Proſecutor, Witneſs, 
and Judge? What can private malice

wiſh for more, than ſuch a court of ie, 
at which to arraign its enemy ? The 
ſtiletto of the Aſſaſſin is not fo ſure, ot 
ſo fatal to innocence. I now perceive, 
that it avails me nothing to be guiltleſs; 
a ſingle cnemy is {uficient to accompliſh 
my deſtruction.“ | 

* You have an enemy then?“ obſerved 
the Inquiſitor. 

Vivaldi was too weil convinced that he 
had one, but there was not ſufficient prot, 
as to the perſon of this enemy, to juſtify 
him in afferting that it was Schedoni. 
The circumſtance of Ellena having been 
arreſted, would have compelled him to 
ſuſpe&amp; another perſon as being at leaſt 
acceſſary to the deſigns of the Confeflor, 
had not credulity ſtarted in horror from 
the ſuppoſition, that a mother's reſent- 
ment could poſſibly betray her fon into 
the priſons of the Inquiſition, though this 
mother had exhibited a temper of re- 
morſeleſs cruelty towards a ſtranger, who 


had interrupted her views for that ſon. 
6c You 


( 215 ) 

&amp; You have an enemy then?“ repeated 
the Inquiſitor. 

«* That I am here ſufficiently proves it,“ 
replied Vivaldi. © But I am ſo little any 
man's enemy, that I know not who to call 
mine.” 

« It is evident, then, that you have no 
enemy,“ obſerved the ſubtle Inquiſitor, 
and that this accuſation is brought 
againſt you by a reſpecter of truth, and 
a faitliful ſervant of the Roman intereſt.” 

Vivaldi was ſhocked to perceive the 
inſidious art, by which he had been be- 
trayed into a declaration apparently ſo 


harmleſs, and the cruel dexterity with 


which 1t had been turned againſt him. A 
lofty and contemptuous filence was all 
that he oppoſed to the treachery of his 
examiner, on whoſe countenance appear- 
ed a {mile of triumph and felf-congratula- 
tion, the life of a fellow creature being, in 
his eſtimation, of no comparative impor- 
tance with the ſelf-applauſes of ſucceſs-

valued himſelt—that of his profeſſion. 

The Inquiſitor proceeded, © You per- 
fiſt, then, in withholding the truth?“ 
He pauſed, but Vivaldi making no reply, 
he reſumed. 

“Since it is evident, from your own 
declaration, that you have no enemy, 
whom private reſentment might have in. 
ſtigated to accule you; and, from other 
circumſtances which have occurred in 
your conduct, that you are conſcious of

againſt you, is not a malicious flander. | 
exhort you, therefore, and once more con- 
jure you, by our holy faith, to make an

ingenuous confeſſion of your offences, and 5 
to ſave yourſelf from the means, which *

I adjure you, allo, to conſider, that by 
ſuch open conduct only, can mercy be

&gt; righteous tribunal !” 
Vuoiraldi, perceiving that it was now ne- 
ceſtury for him to reply, once more ſo- 
' W l:mnly aſſerted his innocence of the crime 


alledged againſt him in the ſummons, and 


of the conſciouſneſs of any act, which 
WW night lawfully ſubje&amp; him to the notice 
ol the Holy Office. 

"WH The Inquiſitor again demanded what 
"FE was the crime alledged, and, Vivaldi having 
3 repeated the accuſation, he again bade the 
© Secretary note it, as he did which, Vivaldi 
&gt; WW thought he perceived upon his features 

ſomething of a malignant ſatisfaction, for 

nich he knew not how to account. 
 ® W' When the Secretary had finiſhed, Vivaldi 

and was ordered to ſubſcribe his name and

an obeyed.

in vain expectation, for the fect ot horſes, 
and the voice of Vivaldi, who, ſhe had 
been told, was following on the fame 
road. 

The ſteps of travellers ſeldom broke 
upon the ſilence of theſe regions, and, 
during the journey, ſhe was met only by 
ſome market-people paſſing to a neigh- 
bouring town, or now and then by the 
vine-dreſſers or labourers in the olive 
grounds; and ſhe deſcended upon the vaſt 
plains of Apulia, ſtill ignorant of her ſi- 
tuation. An encampment, not of war- 
riors, but of ſhepherds, who were leading 
their flocks to the mountains of Abruzzo, 
enlivened a {mall tract of theſe levels. 
which were ſhadowed on the north and 
caſt by the mountainous ridge of the 
Garganus, ſtretching from the Appennine 
far into the Adriatic. 

The appearance of the ſhepherds was 
nearly as wild and ſavage, as that of the 
men who conducted Ellena ; but their 


paſtoral 


F 


paſtoral inſtruments of flageolets and ta- 
bors ſpoke of more civilized feelings, as 
they founded ſweetly over the deſert. 
Her guards reſted, and refreſhed them- 
ſelves with goats milk, barley cakes, and 
almonds; and the manners of theſe ſhep- 
herds, like thoſe ſhe had formerly met 
with on the mountains, proved to be more 
hoſpitable than their air had indicated. 
Alter Ellena had quitted this paſtoral 
camp, no veſtige of a human reſidence ap- 
peared for ſeveral leagues, except here and 
there tlie towers of a decayed fortreſs, 
perched upon the lofty acclivities ſhe was 
approaching, and half concealed in the 
woods. The evening of the ſecond day 
was drawing on, when her guards drew 
near the foreſt, which ſhe had long ob- 
ſerved in the diſtance, ſpreading over the 
many -riſing ſteeps of the Garganus. They 
entered by a track, a road it could not be 
called, which led among oaks and gigantic

ries, and ſo thickly interwoven, that they 
branches formed a canopy which ſeldom 
emitted the ſkv. The gloom which they 
turew around, and the thickets of cyſtus, 

N and lenticas, which flouriſhed 

cath the ſhade, gave a character of fearful 
wildne{ to the ſcene. 

Having reached an eminence, where tie 
trees were more thinly 1cattered, Eller. 
perceived the foreſts ſpreading on all fide: 
among hills and vallies, and deſcending to- 
wards the Adriatic, which bonne the 
diſtance in front. The coaſt, bending in- 
to a bay, was rocky and bold. Loſty 
Pinnacles, wooded to their ſummits, roſe 
over the ſhores, and cliffs of naked marble 
of ſuch gigantic proportions, that they 
were awful even at a diſtance, obtru« 
themſelves far into the waves, breaſt: 


their eternal fury. Beyond the margin 3 
the coaſt, as far as the eye could reach, ap- 


peared pointed mountains, « d. rkened with

ſoreſts, riſing ridge over ridge in many (uc- 
ceſſions. Ellena, as ſhe ſurveyed this wild 
ſcenery, felt as it ſhe was going into eternal 
baniſhment from ſociety. She was tran— 
quil, but it was with the quietneſs of ex- 


hauſted grief, not of reſignation; and ſhe 


looked back upon the paſt, and awaited 


the future, with a kind of out-breathed 
deſpair. 

She had travelled for ſome miles through 
the foreſt, her guards only now and thenut- 
tering to each other a queſtion, or an ob- 
ſervation concerning the changes, which 
had taken place in the bordering ſcenery, 
fince they laſt paſſod it, when night began 
to cloſe in upon them. 

Ellena perceived her approach to the ſea, 
only by the murmurs of its ſurge upon the 
rocky coaſt, till, having reached an emi- 
nence, which was, however, no more than the 
baſe of two woody mountains, that tower- 
ca cloſely over it, ſhe ſaw dimly its gray 
ſurface ſpreading in the bay below. She

now ventured to aſk how much further ſhe 


was to go, and whether ſhe was to be taken 


on board one of the little veſſels, appa-

one of the guards, ſurlily; © you wil

They deſcended to the ſhore, and pre- 
ſently came to a lonely dwelling, which 
ſtood ſo near the margin of the fea, as al- 
molt to be waſhed by the waves. No light 
appeared at any of the lattices ; and, from 
the filence that reigned within, it ſeemed 
to be uninhabited. The guard had pro- 
bably reafon to know otherwiſe, for they 
halted at the door, and ſhouted with all 
their ſtrength. No voice, however, an- 
ſwered to their call, and, while they perſe- 
vered in efforts to rouſe the inhabitants, 
Ellena anxiouſly examined the building, 


as exactly as the twilight would permit. 
It 


(-- 885-3 
t was of an ancient and peculiar ſtructure, 
and, though ſcarcely important enough for 


| 2 manſion, had evidently never been de- 
E figned for the reſidence of peaſants. 


Thewalls, of unhewn marble, werehigh, 


and ſtrengthened by baſtions; and the edi- 
fice had turretted corners, which, with 
the porch in front, and the ſloping roof, 


were falling faſt into numerous ſymptoms 
of decay. The whole building, with its 
dark windows and ſoundleſs avenues, had 


an air ſtrikingly forlorn and ſolitary. A 


high wall ſurrounded the ſmall court in 


which it ſtood, and probably had once 


ſerved as a defence to the dwelling ; but 
the gates, which ſhould have cloſed againſt 
intruders, could no longer periorm their 
office ; one of the folds had dropped from 
its faſtenings, and lay on the ground al- 
moſt concealed in a deep bed of weeds, 


and the other creaked on its hinges to 
every blaſt, at each ſwing ſeeming ready to 
| follow the fate of its companion.

The repeated calls of the guard, weir, 
at length, anſwered by a rough voice 
from within ; when the door of the porch 
was lazily unbarred, and opencd by a man, 
whole viſage was ſo miſery-{truck, that 
Ellena could not look upon it with indif. 
ference, though wrapt in miſery of he 
own. The lamp he held threw a glcan 
athwart it, and ſhewed the gaunt ferocttr 
of famine, to which the ſhadow of his hol 
low eyes added a terrific wildneſs. Ellena 
ſhrunk while ſhe gazed. She had never 
before ſeen villainy and ſuffering ſo ſtrong- 
ly pictured on the ſame face, and ſhe ob- 
{ſerved him with a degree of thrilling cu- 
rioſity, which fora moment excluded from 
her mind all conſciouſneſs of the evils t 
be apprehended from him. 

It was evident that this houſe had not 
been built for his reception; and ſhe 
conjectured, that he was the ſervant ct 
ſome cruel agent of the Marcheſa i 
Vivaldi,

From the porch, ſhe followed into an 
old hall, ruinous, and deſtitute of any kind 
of furniture. It was not extenſive but 
lofty, for it ſeemed to aſcend to the roof 
of the edifice, and the chambers above 
opened around it into a corridor, 

Some halt- ſullen ſalutations were ex- 
changed between the guard and the ſtran- 
ger, whom they called Spalatro, as they 
paſſed into a chamber, where, it appeared, 
that he had been fleeping on a mattreſs 
laid in a corner. All the other furnitute 
of the place were two or three broken 
chairs and a table. He eyed Ellena with 
2 ſhrewd contracted brow, and then look- 
ed ſignificantly at the guard, but was ſi- 
lent, till he defired them all to ſit down, 
adding, that he would drets ſome fiſh for 
ſupper. Ellena diſcovered that this man 
was the maſter of the place ; 1t appeared 
alſo, that he was the only inhabitant; 
and, when the guard ſoon after informed 
her their journey concluded here, herworſt

apprehenſions were confirmed. The ccf. 
forts ſhe made to ſuſtain her ſpirits, 
were no longer ſucceſsful. It ſeemed that 
ſhe was brought hither by ruthans to a 
lonely houſe on the ſea-ſhore, inhabited 
by a man, who had © villain” engraved in 
every line of his face, to be the victim of 
inexorable pride and an infatiable deſire of 
revenge. After conſidering theſe circum- 
ſtances, and the words, which had juſt told 
her ſhe was to go no further, conviction 
ſtruck like lightning upon her heart; and, 
believing ſhe was brought hither to be al- 
ſaſſinated, horror chilled all her frame, and 
her ſenſes forſook her. 

On recovering, the found herſelf ſur- 
rounded by the guard and the ſtranger, 
and ſhe would have ſupplicated for their 
pity, but that ſhe feared to exaſperate 
them by betraying her ſuſpicions. She 
complained of fatigue, and requeſted to 
be ſhewn to her room. The men looked 
upon one another, heſitated, and then

aſked her to partake of the fiſh that was 
preparing. But Ellena having declined 
the invitation with as good a grace as ſhe 
could aſſume, they conſented that ſhe 
ſhould withdraw. Spalatro, taking the 
lamp, lighted her acroſs the hall, to the 
corridor above, where he opened the door 
of a chamber, in which he ſaid ſhe was to 
ſleep. 

“Where is my bed?” ſaid the afflicted 
Ellena, fearfully as ſhe looked round. 

It is there—on the floor,“ replied 
Spalatro, pointing to a miſerable mattreſs, 
over which hung the tattered curtains of 
what had once been a canopy. If you 
want the lamp,“ he added, © I will leave 
it, and come for it in a minute or two.“ 

„Will you not let me have a lamp for 
the night ?” ſhe ſaid in a ſupplicating and 
timid voice. 

« For the might!” ſaid the man 
eruffly; „ What! to ſet fire to the 
houſe.“

Fllena {till entreated that he would al- 
low her the comfort of a light. 

« Ay, ay,” replied Spalatro, with a 
look ſhe could not comprehend, „it would 
be a great comfort to you, truly! You do 
not know what you aſk.” 

% What is it that you mean?“ {aid El- 
lena, cagerly ; © I conjure you, in the name 
of our holy church, to tell me!? 

Spalatro ſtepped ſuddenly back, and 
looked upon her with ſurpriſe, but with- 
out ſpeaking. 

Have mercy on me!” ſaid Ellena, 
greatly alarmed by his manner; “ I am 
friendleſs, and without help?? 

« What do you fear,“ ſaid the man, re- 
covering himſelf; and then, without wait- 
ing her reply, added“ Is it ſuch an un- 
mercitul deed to take away a lamp?“ 

Ellena, who again feared to betray the 
extent of her ſuſpicions, only replied, that 
it would be merciful to leave it, for that 
her ſpirits were low, and ſhe required light 


to cheer them in a new abode, 
« Wo

«* We do not ſtand upon ſuch conceits 
here,“ replied Spalatro, “ we have other 
matters to mind. Beſides, its the only 
lamp in the houſe, and the company be- 
low are in darkneſs while I am loſing time 
here. I will leave it for two minutes, and 
no more.” Ellena made a fign for him 
to put down the lamp; and, when he left 
the room, ſhe heard the door barred upon 
her. 

She employed theſe two minutes in ex- 
amining the chamber, and the poſſibility 
it might afford of an eſcape. It was a 
large apartment, unfurniſhed and unſwept 
of the cobwebs of many years. The only 
door ſhe diſcovered, was the one, by which 
ſhe had entered, and the only window a 
lattice, which was grated. Such prepara- 
tion for preventing efcape, ſeemed to hint 
how much there might be to eſcape from. 


Having examined the chamber, with- 


out finding a ſingle circumſtance toencou- 
rage hope, tried the ſtrength of the bars,

which ſhe could not ſhake, and fought in 
vain for an inſide faſtening to her door, ſhe 
placed the lamp beſide it, and awaited the 
return of Spalatro. In a few moments he 
came, and offered her a cup of four wine 
with a ſlice of bread ; which, being ſome- 
what ſoothed by this attention, ſhe did not 
think proper to reject. 

Spalatro then quitted the room, and 
the door was again barred. Left once 
more alone, ſhe tried to overcome appre- 
henſion by prayer; and after offering up 


her veſpers with a fervent heart, ſhe be- 


came more confiding and compoſed. 
But it was impoſſible that ſhe could fo 
far forget the dangers of her ſituation, as 
to ſeek ſleep, however wearied ſhe might 
be, while the door of her room remained 
unſecured againſt the intruſion of the rut- 
fians below; and, as ſhe had no means of 
faſtening it, ſhe determined to watch dur- 
ing the whole night. Thus left to ſoli- 
tude and darknels, ſhe ſeated herſelf upon 
| the 


6 233 ) 

the mattreſs to await the return of morn- 
ing, and was ſoon loſt in ſad reflection; 
every minute occurrence of the paſt day, 
and of the conduct of her guards, moved 
in review before her judgment; and, com- 
bining theſe with the circumſtances of her 
preſent ſit uation, ſcarcely a doubt as to the 
fate deſigned for her remained. It ſeemed 
highly improbable, that the Marcheſa di 
Vivaldi had ſent her hither merely for im- 
priſonment, ſince ſhe might have confined 
her in a convent, with much leſs trouble; 
and ſtill more ſo, when Ellena conſidered the 
character of the Marcheſa, ſuch as the had 
already experienced it. The appearance 
of this houſe, and of the man who inha- 
bited it, with the circumſtance of no wo- 
man being found reſiding here, each and 
all of theſe ſignified, that ſhe was brought 
hither, not for long impriſonment, but for 
death. Her utmoſt efforts for fortitude, 
or reſignation could not overcome the cold 
tremblings, the ſickneſs of heart, the faint- 

neſs 


( 234 } 
neſs and univerſal horror, that aſſailed her, 
How often, with tears of mingled terror 
and grief, did the call upon Vivaldi vi. 
valdi, alas! far diſtant to fave her; hoy 
often exclaim in agony, that ſhe ſhould 
never, never {ce him more | 

She was {pared, however, the horror cf 
believing that he was an inhabitant of the 
Inquiſition. Having detected the impo- 
ſition, which had been practiſed towards 
herſelf, and that ſhe was neither on thc 
way to the Holy Office, nor conducted by 
perſons belonging to it, ſhe concluded, 
that the whole affair of Vivaldi's arreſt, had 
been planned by the Marcheſa, merely a 


2 


a pretence for confining him, till ſhe 
ſhould be placed beyond the reach of his 
aſſiſtance. She hoped, therefore, that he 
had only been ſent to ſome private refi— 
dence belonging to his family, and that, 
when her fate was decided, he would be 
releaſed, and the be the only victim. This 
was the fole confideration, that afforded 
any

( 235 ) 

ny degree of aſſuagement to her ſuffer-

The people below fat till a late hour. 
She liſtened often to their diſtant voices, as 
they were diſtinguiſhable in the pauſes of 
the ſurge, that broke loud and hollow on 

e ſhore 3 and cvery time the creaking 
g inges of their room door moved, appre- 
hended they were coming to her. At 
length, it appeared they had left the apart- 
ment, or had fallen aſleep there, for a pro- 
found ſtillneſs reigned whenever the mur- 
mur of the waves ſunk. Doubt did not 
long deceive her, for, while 8 e 
ſhe diſtinguiſhed footſteps aſcending to 
the corridor. She heard them approach 
her chamber, and ftop at the door; ſhe 
heard, alſo, the low whuperings of their 
voices, as they ſeemed conſulting on what 


was to be done, and ſhe ſcarcely ventured 


to draw breath, while the e attend- 
ed to them. Not a word, however, diſ- 
tinctly reached her, till, as one of them

was departing, another called out in: 
half-whifper, © It is below on the table, 
in my girdle; make haſte.” The man 
came back, and ſaid ſomething in 4 
lower voice, to which the other replied, 
« ſhe ſleeps,” or Ellena was deceived by 
the hiſſing conſonants of ſome other 
words. He then deſcended the itair:; 
and in a few minutes ſhe perceived his 
comrade alſo paſs away from the door; (he 
liſtened to his retreating ſteps, till the roar- 
ing of the ſea was alone heard in ther 
ſtead. 

Ellena's terrors were relieved only for a 
moment. Conſidering the import of the 
words, it appeared that the man who had 
deſcended, was gone for the ſtiletto of the 
other, ſuch an inſtrument being uſually 
worn in the girdle, and from the aſſurance, 
* ſhe ſleeps,” he ſeemed to fear that his 
words had been overheard; and ſhe liſten- 
ed again for their ſteps; but they came 


NO more. 


Happily 


( 237 ) 
Happily for Ellena's peace, ſhe knew 


not that her chamber had a door, fo con- 
trived as to open without ſound, by which 
aſſaſſins might enter unſuſpectedly at any 
hour of the night. Believing that the in- 
habitants of this houſe had now retired to 
reſt, her hopes and her ſpirits began to re- 
vive; but ſhe was yet ſleepleſs and watch- 
ful. She meaſured the chamber with un- 
| equal ſteps, often ſtarting as the old 


boards ſhook and groaned where ſhe paſ- 


© {ed ; and often pauſing to liſten whether 
all was yet ſtill in the corridor. The 
gleam, which a riſing moon threw between 
the bars of her window, now began to 
ſhew many ſhadowy objects in the cham- 
ber, which ſhe did not recollect to have 
obſerved while the lamp was there. More 
than once, ſhe fancied ſhe faw ſomething 
| glide along towards the place where the 
| mattreſs was laid, and, almoſt congealed 
with terror, ſhe ſtood ſtill to watch it; 
but the illuſion, if ſuch it was, diſappeared 


where 


( 238 ) 
where the moon-light faded, and even her 
fears could not give ſhape to it beyond. 
Had ſhe not known that her chamber. 
door remained ſtrongly barred, ſhe would 
have beheved this was an aflaſſin ſtealing 
to the bed where it might be ſuppoſed ſhe 
ſlept. Even now the thought occurre 
to her, and vague as it was, had power tg 
ſtrike an anguiſh, almoſt deadly, through 
her heart, while ſhe conſidered that her im- 
mediate ſituation was nearly as perilous as 
the one ſhe had imaged. Again ſhe liſtened, 
and ſcarcely dared to breathe, but not the 
lighteft ſound occurred in the paulcs ol 
the waves, and ſhe believed herſelf con- 
vinced that no perſon except herſelf wa: 
in the room. That ſhe was deceived in 
this belief, appeared from her unwillingnc! 
to approach the mattreſs, while it was yet 
involved in ſhade. Unable to ovyer- 
come her reluctance, {hs took her ſtation 
at the window, till the ſtrengthening rays 
ſhould allow a clearer view of the cham-

ber, and in ſome degree reſtore her confi- 
dence; and ſhe watched the ſcene without 
as it gradually became viſible. The moon, 
riſing over the ocean, ſhewed its reſtleſs 
ſurface ſpreading to the wide horizon ; 
and the waves, which broke in foam upon 
the rocky beach below, retiring in long 
white lines far upon the waters. She 
liſtened to their meaſured and ſolemn 
ſound, and, ſomewhat foothed by the ſoli- 
tary grandeur of the view, remained at the 
attice till the moon had riſen high into 
the heavens ; and even till morning began 
to dawn upon the ſca, and purple the 
caſtern clouds. 

Re- aſſured, by the light that now per- 
vaded her room, ſhe returned to the mat- 
treſs; where anxiety at length yielded to 
her wearineſs, and ſhe obtained a ſhort 
repole,

ExIENA was awakened from profound 


ſleep, by a loud noiſe at the door of her 
chamber; when, ſtarting from her mat- 
treſs, ſhe looked around her with ſurpriſe 
and diſmay, as imperfect recollections of 
the paſt began to gather on her mind, 
She diſtinguiſhed the undrawing of iron 
bars, and then the countenance of Spalatro 
at her deor, before ſhe had a clear remem- 
brance of her ſituation that ſhe was a 
priſoner in a houſe on a lonely ſhore, and 


that this man was her jailor, Such fick-

neſs of the heart returned with theſe con- 


| victions, ſuch faintneſs and terror, that 
unable to ſupport her trembling frame, 
ſhe ſunk again upon the mattreſs, with- 


out demanding the reaſon of this abrupt 


E intruſion,

faid Spalatro, © if you are awake to take 


it; but you ſeem. to be aſleep yet. Surely 
you have had ſleep ſufficient for one might ; 
you went to reſt ſoon enough.” 

Ellena made no reply, but, deeply af- 


ſected with a ſenſe of her ſituation, looked 
F with beſeeching eyes at the man, who ad- 
E vanced, holding forth an oaten cake and 
Ja baſon of milk. © Where ſhall I ſet 
them?“ ſaid he, © you muſt needs be 
glad of them, ſince you had no ſupper.” 


Ellena thanked him, and deſired he 


would place them on the floor, for there 
as neither table nor chair in the room. 
As he did this, ſhe was ſtruck with the 
| expreſſion of his countenance, which ex- 


VOL. 11. M hibited 


( 242 ) 
hibited a ſtrange mixture of archneſs and 
malignity. He ſeemed congratulating 
himſelf upon his ingenuity, and anticipa- 
ting ſome occaſion of triumph; and ſhe 
was ſo much intereſted, that her obſerva- 
tion never quitted him while he remained 
in the room. As his eyes accidentally met 
| her's, he turned them away, with the ab- 
ruptneſs of a perſon who is conſcious of 
evil intentions, and fears leſt they ſhou'd 
be detected; nor once looked up till he 
was haſtily quitting the chamber, and ſhe 
then heard the door ſecured as formerly. 
The impreſſion, which his look had 
left on her mind, ſo wholly engaged her 
in conjecture, that a conſiderable time 
elapſed before ſhe remembered that he 
had brought the refreſhment (he ſo much 
required; but, as ſhe now lifted it to her 
lips, a horrible ſuſpicion arreſted her hand; 
it was not, however, before ſhe had ſwal- 
lowed a ſmall quantity of the milk. The 
look of Spalatro, which had occafioned her 
| ſurpriſe, 


YT 


Ls 


( 243 ) 

ſurpriſe, had accompanied the ſetting down 
of the breakfaſt, and it occurred to her, 
that poiſon was infuſed in this liquid. She 
was thus compelled to refuſe the ſuſte- 
nance, which was become neceſſary to her, 
for ſhe feared to taſte even of the oaten 
cake, ſince Spalatro had offered it, but the 
little milk ſhe had unwarily taken was fo 
very ſmall, that ſhe had no apprehenſion 
concerning it. 

The day, however, was paſſed in terror, 
and almoſt in deſpondency ; ſhe could nei- 
ther doubt the purpoſe for which ſhe had 
been brought hither, nor diſcover any poſſi- 
bility of eſcaping ſrom her perſecutors; yet 
that propenſity to hope, which buoys up 
the human heart, even in the ſevereſt mo- 
ments of trial, ſuſtained, in ſome degree, 
her fainting ſpirits. 

During theſe miſerable hours of ſoli— 
tude and ſuſpenſe, the only alleviation to 
her ſuffering aroſe from a belict, that Vi- 
valdi was ſafe, at leaſt from danger, thougi 
M 2 not

not from grief ; but ſhe now underſtood 
too much of the dexterous contrivances 
of the Marcheſa, his mother, to think it 
was practicable fur him to eſcape from 
her deſigns, and again reſtore her to 
liberty. 

All day Ellena either leaned againſt the 
bars of her window, loſt in reverie, while 
her unconſcious eyes were fixed upon the 
ocean, whoſe murmurs ſhe no longer 
heard; or ſhe liſtened for ſome ſound 
from within the houſe, that might aſſiſt 
her conjectures, as to the number of 
perſons below, or what might be paſ⸗ 
ſing there. The houſe, however, was 
profoundly ſtill, except when now and 
then a footſtep ſauntered along a diſtant 
paſſage, or a door was heard to cloſe ; but 
not the hum of a ſingle voice aroſe from 
the lower rooms, nor any ſymptom of 
there being more than one perſon, beſide 
herſelf, in the dwelling. Though ſhe had 
not heard her former guards depart, it 


appeared 


1 
t 
| 


6 245 ) 
appeared certain that they were gone, and 
that ſhe was left alone in this place with 
Spalatro. What could be the purport of 
ſuch a proceeding, Ellena could not ima- 
gine ; if her death was deſigned, it ſeemed 
ſtrange that one perſon only ſhould be left 
to the hazard of thedeed, when three muſt 
have rendered the completion of it certain. 
But this ſurpriſe vaniſhed, when her ſul- 
picion of porſon returned; for it was pro- 
bable, that theſe men had believed their 
ſcheme to be already nearly accompliſhed, 
and had abandoned her to die alone, in a 
chamber from whence eſcape was imprac- 
ticable, leaving Spalatro to diſpoſe of her 
remains. All the incongruities ſhe had 
ſeparately obſerved in their conduct, ſeem- 
ed now to harmonize and unite in one 
plan; and her death, deſigned by poiſon, 
and that poiſon to be conveyed in the diſ- 
guiſe of nouriſhment, appeared to have 
been the object of it. Whether it was that 
the ſtrength of this conviction affected her 
M3 fancy, 


( 246 

fancy, or that the cauſe was real, Ellena, 
remembering at this moment that ſhe 
had taſted the nulk, was ſeized with an 
univerſal ſhuddering, and thought ſhe 
felt that the poiſon had been ſufficiently 
potent to affect her, even in the inconſi- 
derable quantity ſhe might have taken. 

While ſhe was thus agitated, ſhe diſ. 
tinguiſhed ſootſtepsloitering near her door, 
and attentively liſtening, became con- 
vinced, that ſome perſon was in the corri- 
dor. The ſteps moved ſoftly, ſome- 
times ſtopping for an inſtant, as if to al- 
low time for liſtening, and ſoon after 
paſſed away. 

It is Spalatro !” ſaid Ellena; © he be- 
lieves that I have taken the poiſon, and he 
comes to liſten for my dying groans 
Alas ! he is only come ſomewhat too ſoon, 
perhaps!“ 

As this horrible ſuppoſition occurred, 
the ſhuddering returned with encreaſcd 


violence, and ſhe ſunk, almoſt fainting, on 
the 


( 247 )) 

the mattreſs ; but the fit was not of long: 
continuance, When it gradually left her, 
and recollection revived, ſhe perceived, 
however, the prudence of ſuffering Spala- 
tro to ſuppoſe ſhe had taken the li— 
quid he brought her, fince ſuch belief 
would at leaſt procure {ome delay of fur- 
ther ſchemes, and every delay afforded 
ſome poſſibility for hope to reſt upon. 
Ellena, therefore, poured through the bars 
of her window, the milk, which ſhe believed 
Spalatro had deſigned ſhould be fatal in its 
conſeqnence. 

It was evening, when ſhe again fancied 
footſteps were lingering near her door, and 
the ſuſpicion was confirmed, when, on 
turning her eyes, ſhe perceived a ſhade on 
the floor, underneath it, as of ſome perſon 
ſtationed without. Preſently the ſhadow . 
glided away, and at the ſame time ſhe 
diſtinguiſhed departing ſteps treading cau- 
tiouſly. 

It is he!“ ſaid Ellena ; ** he ſtill liſtens 


for my moans !” 
M 4. This 


: ( 248 ) 


This further confirmation of his deſigns 
affected her nearly as much as the firſt; 
when, anxiouſly turning her looks toward; 
the corridor, the ſhadow again appeared 
beneath the door, but ſhe heard no ſtep, 
Ellena watched it with intenſe ſolici- 
tude and expectation ; fearing every in- 
ſtant that Spalatro would conclude her 
doubts by entering the room. © And 
when he diſcovers that I live,” thought 
ſhe, © what may I not expect during the 
firſt moments of his diſappointment ! 
What leſs than immediate death!“ 

The ſhadow, after remaining a few mi- 
nutes ſtationary, moved a little, and then 
glided away as before. But it quickly re- 
turned, and a low ſound followed, as of 
ſome perſon endeavouring to unfaſten 
bolts without noiſe. Ellena heard one 
bar gently undrawn, and then another ; 
ſhe obſerved the door begin to move, and 
then to give way, till it gradually uncloſ- 
ed, and the face of Spalatro preſented 1t-

ſelf from behind it. Without immediate- 
ly entering, he threw a glance round the 
chamber, as if he wiſhed to aſcertain ſome 
circumſtance before he ventured further. 
His Iook was more than uſually haggard 
as it reſted upon Ellena, who apparently 
repoſed on her mattreſs. 

Having gazed at her for an inſtant, he 
ventured towards the bed with quick and 
unequal ſteps ; his countenance expreſſed 
at orice impatience, alarm, and the con- 
ſciouſneſs of guilt. When he was within 
a few paces, Ellena raiſed herſelf, and he 
farted back as if a ſudden ſpectre had 
croſſed him. The more than uſual wild- 
neſs and wanneſs of his looks, with the 
whole of his conduct, ſeemed to confirm 
all her former terror; and, hen he rough- 
ly aſked. her how ſhe did, Ellena had not 
ſufficient preſence of mind to anſwer that 
me was ill. For ſome moments, he rc- 
garded her with an earneſt and ſullen at- 
tention, and then a fly glance of ſcrut iny,

which he threw round the chamber, told 
her that he was enquiring whether ſhe had 
taken the poiſon. On perceiving that the 
baſon was empty, he lifted 1t from the 
floor, and Ellena fancied a gleam of ſatis- 
faction paſſed over his viſage. 

*« You have had no dinner,” ſaid he,“ J 
forgot you; but ſupper will ſoon be ready; 
and you may walk upon the beach till 
then, if you will.“ 

Elena, extremely ſurpriſed and per- 
plexed by this offer of a ſeeming indul- 
gence, knew not whether to accept or re- 
ject it. She ſuſpected that ſome treachery 
lurked within it. The invitation appea:- 
ed to be only a ſtratagem to lure her to 
deſtruction, and ſhe determined to decline 
accepting it; when again ſhe conſidered, 
that to accompliſh this, it was not neceftary 
to withdraw her from the chamber, where 
ſhe was already ſufficiently in the power of 
her perſecutors. Her ſituvation could not 
be more deſperate than it was at pre- 


ſent, 


(ir 


ſent, and almoſt any change miglit make it 


leſs ſo. 

As ſhe deſcended from the corridor, and 
paſſed through the lower part of the houſe, 
no perſon appeared but her conductor; 
and ſhe ventured to enquire, whether the 


men who had brought her hither were de- 


parted. Spalatro d1d not return an an- 


wer, but led the way in filence to the 


court, and, having paſſed the gates, he 
pointed toward the weſt, and faid ſhe 

might walk that way. . 
Lllena bent her courle towards the“ ma- 
ny-foundingwaves,” foliowed ata ſhort diſ- 
tance by Spalatro, and, wrapt in thought, 
purſued the windings of the thore, ſcarce- 
ly noticing the objects around her ; till, 
on paſling the foot of a rock, ſhe lifted her 
eyes to the icene that uniolded beyond, 
and obſerved ſome huts ſcattered at a con- 
ſiderable diſtance, apparently the reſidence 
of fiſhermen. She could juſt diſtinguiſh.

cliffs, and entering the little bay, where the 
hamlet margined the beach ; but, though 
ſhe ſaw the ſails lowered, as the boats ap- 
proached the ſhore, they were too far off 
to allow the figures of the men to appear, 
To Ellena, who had believed that no hu- 
man habitation, except her priſon, inter- 
rupted the vaſt ſolitudes of theſe foreſts 
and ſhores, the view of the huts, remote 
as they were, imparted a feeble hope, and 
even ſomewhat of joy. She looked back, 
to obſerve whether Spalatro was near; he 
was already within a few paces; and, caſt- 
ing a wiſtful glance forward to the remote 
cottages, her heart ſunk again. 
It was a lowering evening, and the (ea 
was dark and {ſwelling ; the ſcreams of the 
fea-birds too, as they wheeled among the 
clouds, and fought their high neſts in the 
rocks, ſeemed to indicate an approaching 
ſtorm. Ellena was not ſo wholly engaged 
by ſelfiſh ſufferings, but that ſhe could 

ſympathiſe with thoſe of others, and 
| ſhe 


(BS. 
ſhe rejoiced that the fiſhermen, whoſe 
boats ſhe had obſerved, had eſcaped the 
threatening tempeſt, and were ſafely ſhel- 
tered 1n their little homes, where, as they 
heard the loud waves break along the 


coaſt, they could look with keener plea- 


ſure upon the ſocial circle, and the warm 
comforts around them. From ſuch con- 
ſiderat ions, however, ſhe returned again to 
a ſenſe of her own forlorn and friendleſs 
ſituation. 

« Alas!” ſaid ſhe, © I have no longer a 
home, a circle to ſmile welcomes upon 
me! I have no longer even one friend to 
ſupport, to reſcue me! Ia miſerable 
wanderer on a diſtant ſhore ! tracked, per- 
haps, by the footſteps of the aſſaſſin, who 
at this inſtant eyes his victim with ſilent 
watchfulneſs, and awaits the mement of 
opportunity to ſacrifice her!” 

Ellena ſhuddered as ſhe ſaid this, and 
turned again to obſerve whether Spalatro 
was near. He was not within view; and, 
while ſhe wondered, and congratulated 
herſelf 


( 254 ) 
herſelf on a poſſibility of eſcaping, ſhe per- 
ceiveda Monk walking filently beneath the 
dark rocks that overbrowed the beach. His 
black garments were folded round him ; 


his face was inclined towards the ground, 


and he had the air of a man in deep me- 
ditation. 


His, no doubt, are worthy muſings!” 


ſaid Ellena, as ſhe obferved him, with 
mingled hope and ſurpriſe. “I may ad- 
dreſs myſelf, without fear, to one of his 
order. It is probably as much his wil, 
as it is his duty, to ſuccour the unfortu- 
nate. Who could have hoped to find 
on this ſequeſtered ſhore ſo ſacred a pro- 
tector! his convent cannot be far off.” 


He approached, his face ſtill bent to- 


wards the ground, and Ellena advanced 
ſlowly, and with tremblirg ſteps, to meet 
him. As he drew near, he viewed her 
aſkance, without lifting his head; but ſhe 


perceived his large eyes locking from un- 


der the ſhade of his cowl, and the upper 
| 1 part 


( 255 ) 
part of his peculiar countenance. Her 
confidence in his protection began to fail, 
and ſhe faltered, unable to ſpeak, and 
ſcarcely daring to meet his eyes. The 
Monk ſtalked paſt her in ſilence, the lower 
part of his viſage ſtill muffied in his dra- 
pery, and as he paſſed her looked neither 
with curioſity, nor ſurpriſe. 

Ellena pauſed, and determined, when 
he ſhould be at ſome diſtance, to endea- 
vour to make her way to the hamlet, and 
throw herſelf upon the humanity of its 
inhabitants, rather than ſolicit the pity of 
this forbidding ſtranger. But in the next 
moment ſhe heard a ſtep behind her, and, 
on turning, ſaw the Monk again approach- 
ing. He ſtalked by as before, ſurveying 
her, however, with a fly and ſcrutinizing 
glance from the corners of his eyes. His 
ar and countenance were equally repulſive, 
and ſtill Ellena could not ſummon courage 
enough to attempt engaging his compaſ- 


hon; but ſhrunk as from an enemy. 
There 


( 256 } 

There was ſomething alſo terrific in the 
ſilent ſtalk of ſo gigantic a form; it an- 
nounced both power and treachery. He 
paſſed flowly on to ſome diſtance, and 
diſappeared among the rocks. 

Ellena turned once more with an in- 
tention of haſtening towards the diſtant 
hamlet, before Spalatro ſhould obſerve her, 
whoſe ſtrange abſence ſhe had ſcarcely 
time to wonder at ; but ſhe had not pro- 
ceeded far, when ſuddenly ſhe perceived 
the Monk again at her ſhoulder. She 
ſtarted, and almoſt ſhrieked ; while he re- 
garded her with more attention than be- 
fore. He pauſed a moment, and ſeemed 
to heſitate ; after which he again paſſed 
on in filence, The diſtreſs of Ellena en- 
creaſed; he was gone the way ſhe had de- 
ſigned to run, and ſhe feared almoſt equal- 
ly to follow him, and to return to her pri- 
{on. Preſently he turned, and paſſed her 
again, and Ellena haſtened forward. But, 
when fearful of being purſued, ſhe again 
| | looked 


( 237 ) 
looked back, ſhe obſerved him conver- 
ſing with Spalatro. They appeared to 
be in conſulation, while they ſlowly ad- 
yanced, till, probably obſerving her rapid 
progreſs, Spalatro called on her to ſtop, in 
a voice that echoed among all the rocks. 
It was a voice, which would not be diſ- 
obeyed. She looked hopeleſsly at the flill 


diſtant cottages, and ſlackened her ſteps, 


Preſently the Monk again paſſed before 
her, and Spalatro had again diſappeared. 
The frown, with which the former now re- 
garded Ellena, was ſo terrific, that ſhe 
ſhrunk trembling back, though ſhe knew 
him not for her perſecutor, ſince ſhe had 
never conſciouſly ſeen Schedoni. He was 
agitated, and his look became darker. 

«* Whither go you?“ ſaid he in a voice 
that was ſtifled by emotion. 
_ © Who is it, father, that aſks the queſ- 
tion?“ ſaid Ellena, endeavouring to ap- 
pear compoſed. 

* Whither go you, and who are you?“ 
repeated the Monk more ſternly. 
«c I am 


(2) 


« I am an unhappy orphan,” replied 
Ellena, ſighing deeply,“ It you are, as your 
habit denotes, a friend to the charitics, 
you will regard me with compaſſion.” 

Schedoni was ſilent, and then ſaid— 
* Who, and what is it that you fear?” 

« I fear—even for my life,” replicd 
Ellena, with heſitation. She obſerved a 
darker ſhade paſs over his countenance. 
„For your lite | ſaid he, with apparent 
ſurpriſe, © who is there that would think 
it worth the taking?“ 

Ellena was ſtruck with theſe words. 

Poor inſect !” added Schedoni, who 
would cruſh thee ?” | 

Ellena made no reply ; ſhe remained 
with her eyes fixed in amazement upon 
his face. There was ſomething in his 
manner of pronouncing this, yet more ex- 
traordinary than in the words themſelves. 
Alarmed by his manner, and awed by the 
encreaſing gloom, and ſwelling ſurge, that 
broke in thunder on the beach, ſhe at 

length 


( 259 ) 
length turned away, and again walked 
towards the hamlet, which was yet very 
remote. 

He ſoon overtook her; when rudely 
ſeizing her arm, and gazing earneſtly on 
her face, Who is it, that you fear?“ ſaid 


he, ſay who!“ 


That is more than I dare ſay,” rephed 
Ellena, ſcarcely able to ſuſtain herſelf. 

&amp; Hah ! is it even fo!“ ſaid the Monk; 
with increaſing emotion. His viſage now 
became ſo terrible, that Ellena ſtruggled to 
liberate her arm, and ſupplicated that he 
would not detain her. He was ſilent, and 
ſtill gazed upon her, but his eyes, when 
ſhe had ceaſed to ſtruggle, aſſumed the 
fixt and vacant glare of a man, whoſe 
thoughts have retired within themſelves, 
and who is no longer conſcious to ſur- 
rounding objects. 

* I beſeech you to releaſe me!“ re- 
peated Ellena, it is late, and I am far 
tom home.” 

That 


( 260 ) 


«That is true,” muttered Schedoni, {tif 
graſping her arm, and ſeeming to reply to 
his own thoughts rather than to her words, 
* that is very true.“ 

The evening iscloſing faſt, continued 
Ellena, and I ſhall be overtaken by the 
ſtorm.” | 

Schedoni ſtill muſed, and then mut- 
tered The ſtorm, ſay you? Why ay, 
let it come.” 

As he ſpoke, he ſuffered her arm to 
drop, but ſtill held it, and walked flowly 
towards the houſe. Ellena, thus com- 
pelled to accompany him, and yet more 
alarmed both by his looks, his incoherent 
anſwers, and his approach to her priſon, 
renewed her ſupplications and her efforts 
for liberty, in a voice of piercing diſtreſs, 
adding, I am far from home, father; 
night 1s coming on. See how the rocks 
darken ! I am far from home, and ſhall be 
waited for.” 

„ That is falſe!“ Ga Schedoni, with 
emphaſis ; * and you know it to be ſo.” 

« Alas! 


an 


| friends to wait for me 


En 


« Alas!” I do,” replied Ellena, with 
mingled ſhame and grief, I have no 


“What do thoſe deſerve, who delibe- 


rately utter falſehoods,“ continued the 
| Monk, © who deceive, and flatter young 
men to their deſtruction ?” 


« Father! exclaimed the aſtoniſhed 


Ellena. 


«* Who diſturb the peace of families 


| who trepan, with wanton arts, the heirs 
of noble houſes—who—hah ! what do 
| ſuch deſerve?“ 


Overcome with aſtoniſhment and terror, 


Elena remained filent. She now under- 
| ſtood that Schedoni, ſo far from being like- 
| ly to prove a protector, was an agent of her 
| worſt, and, as ſhe had believed, her only 
enemy; and an apprehenſion of the im- 
| mediate and terrible vengeance, which 
ſuch an agent ſeemed willing to accom- 
 pliſh, ſubdued her ſenſes ; ſhe tottered, 
and ſunk upon the beach. The weight,

which ſtrained the arm Schedoni held, 
called his attention to her ſituation. 

As he gazed upon her helpleſs and faded 
form, he became agitated. He quitted 
it, and traverſed the beach in ſhort turns, 
and with haſty ſteps; came back again, 
and bent over it his heart ſeemed ſenſi- 
ble to ſome touch of pity. At one mo- 
ment, he ſtepped towards the ſea, and 
taking water in the hollows of his hands, 
threw it upon her face; at another, ſeem- 
ing to regret that he had done ſo, he 
would ſtamp with ſudden fury upon the 
ſhore, and walk abruptly to a diſtance, 
The conflict between his deſign and his con- 
ſcience was ſtrong, or, perhaps, it was only 
between his paſſions. He, who had hitherto 
been inſenſible toevery tender feeling, who, 
governed by ambition and refentment, had 
contributed, by his artful inſtigations, to 
fix the balcful reſolution of the Marchela 
di Vivaldi, and who was come to execute 
her puiyjvic,—even he could not nos 

look 


„ 
look upon the innocent, the wretched 
Ellena, without yielding to the momentary 
weaknels, as he termed it, of compaſſion. 
While he was yet unable to baffle the 
| new emotion by evil paſſions, he deſpiſed 
| that which conquered him. * And ſhall 
| the weakneſs of a girl,” ſaid he, © ſubdue 
the reſolution of a man ! Shall the view 
of her tranſient ſufferings unnerve my firm 
| heart, and compel me to renounce the 
| lofty plans I have ſo ardently, ſo labori- 
| ouſly imagined, at the very inſtant when 


» they are changing into realities! Am I 
. WH avake! Is one ſpark of the fire, which 
. has fo long ſmouldered within my boſom, 
y and conſumed my peace, alive! Or am 


o lame and abject as my fortunes ? hah ! as 
o, my fortunes! Shall the ipirit of my fa- 
\) WW ily yield for evet to circumſtances ? The 
o queſtion rouſes it, and I feel its energy 
a WW rcvive within me.” 
He ſtalked with hafty ſteps towards 
Ellena, as if he feared to truſt his reſolu—

tion with a ſecond pauſe. He had a dag. 
ger concealed beneath his Monk's habit, 
as he had alſo an aflaſſin's heart ſhrouded 
by his garments. He had a dagger bu 
he heſitated to uſe it; the blood which 1! 
might ſpill, would be obſerved by the pea- 
ſants of the neighbouring hamlet, and 


might lead to a diſcovery. It would be 
ſafer, he conſidered, and eaſier, to lay Ellee 
na, ſenſeleſs as ſhe was, in the waves; their | 
coldneſs would recal her to life, only at the MW 7 
moment before they would ſuffocate her. 
As he ſtooped to lift her, his reſolution | ,

faltered again, on beholding her innocent 
face, and in that moment ſhe moved. 
He ſtarted back, as if ſhe could have {MW * 


known his purpoſe, and, knowing it, could WM © 
have avenged herſelf. The water, which 1 
he had thrown upon her face, had gra- 8 

11 


dually revived her; ſhe uncloſed her eyes, 
and, on perceiving him, ſhrieked, and at- 
tempted to riſe. His relolution was ſub- 
dued, ſo tremblingly fearful is guilt in the 

| moment 


ders 


the 
ent

moment when it would execute its atro- 


cities. Overcome with apprehenſions, yet 
agitated with ſhame and indignation 


| againſt himſelf for being ſo, he gazed at 
ber for an inſtant in ſilence, and then ab- 
| ruptly turned away his eyes and left her. 


Ellena liſtened to his departing ſteps, and, 


| raiſing herſelf, obſerved him retiring 
among the rocks that led towards the 
| houſe. Aſtoniſhed at his conduct, and ſur- 
priſed to find that ſhe was alone, Ellena 
| renewed all her efforts to ſuſtain herſelf, till 
| ſhe ſhould reach the hamlet fo long the 
object of her hopes; but ſhe had pro- 
ceeded only a few paces, when Spalatro 
ꝛgain appeared ſwiftly approaching. Her 
E utmoſt exertion availed her nothing; her 
teeble ſteps were ſoon overtaken, and El- 


jena perceived herſelf again his priſoner. 


The look with which ſhe reſigned herſelf, 
awakened no pity in Spalatro, who ut- 
red ſome taunting jeſt upon the ſwiftneſs 
tot her flight, as he led her back to her

priſon, and proceeded in ſullen watchful- 
neſs. Once again, then, ſhe entered the 
gloomy walls of that fatal manſion, never 
more, ſhe now believed, to quit them with 
life, a belief, which was ſtrengthened when 
ſhe remembered that the Monk, on leay- 
ing her, had taken the way hither ; for, 
though ſhe knew not how to account for 
his late forbearance, ſhe could not ſuppoſe 
that he would long be merciful. He ap- 
peared no more, however, as ſhe paſſed 
to her chamber, where Spalatro left her 
again to ſolitude and terror, and ſhe heard 
that fateful door again barred upon her. 
When his retreating ſteps had ceaſed to 
found, a ſtillneſs, as of the grave, prevailed 
in the houſe ; like the dead calm, which 
ſometimes precedes the horrors of a tem- 
peſt. *

Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.“ 
| SHAKSPEARE, 


Serrpont had returned from the beach 
to the houſe, in a ſtate of perturbation, 
that defied the controul of even his own 
ſtern will. On the way thither he met 
Spalatro, whom, as he diſpatched him to 
Ellena, he ſtrictly commanded not to ap- 
proach his chamber till he ſhould be 
ſummoned. | 
Having reached his apartment, he ſe- 
cured the door, though not any perſon, 
except himſelf, was in the houſe, nor any 
one expected, but thoſe who he knew 
would not dare to intrude upon him. 
Had it been poſſible to have ſhut out 
all conſciouſneſs of himſelf, alto, how wil- 
N 2 Ungly

lingly would he have done ſo! He threy 
himſelf into a chair, and remained for a 
conſiderable time motionleſs and loſt in 
thought, yet the emotions of his mind 
were violent and contradictory. At the 
very inſtant when his heart reproached 
him with the crime he had meditated, 
he regretted the ambitious views he muſt 
relinquiſh if he failed to perpetrate it, and 
regarded himſelf with ſome degree of con- 
tempt for having hitherto heſitated on the 
ſubject. He conſidered the character of 
his own mind with aſtoniſhment, for cir- 
cumſtances had drawn forth traits, of 
which, till now, he had no ſuſpicion. He 
knew not by what doctrine to explain the 
inconſiſtencies, the contradictions, he ex- 
perienced, and, perhaps, it was not one of 
the leaſt, that in theſe mements of diretul 
and conflicting paſſions, his reaſon could 
{till look down upon their operations, and 
lead him to a cool, though brief examina- 
tion of his own nature. But the ſubtlety 
of 


OO GED Ro OTE 2 PL 


( 269 ) 

of ſelf- love ſtill eluded his enquiries, and 
he did not detect that pride was even at 
this inſtant of ſelf-examination, and of cri- 
tical import, the maſter-ſpring of his mind. 
In the earlieſt dawn of his character, this 
paſhon had diſplayed its predominancy, 
whenever occaſion permitted, and its in- 
fluence had led to ſome of the chict events 
of his life. 

The Count di Marinella, for ſuch had 
formerly been the title of tne Conicio, 
was the younger {on of an ancient family, 
who reſided in the duchy of Milan, and 
near the feet of the Tyrolean Alps, on ſuch 
eſtates of their anceſtors, as the Italian 
wars of a former century had left them. 
The portion, which he had received at 
the death of his father, was not large, and 
Schedoni was not of a diipoſition to im- 
prove his patrimony by flow diligence, or 
to ſubmit to the reſtraint and humiliation, 
which narrow finances would have im- 
poſed. He diſdained to acknowledge an

he conſidered himſelf equal in rank; and, 
as he was deſtitute of generous fee!- 
ing, and of ſound judgment, he had not 
that loftineſs of foul, which is ambitious 
of true grandeur. On the contrary, he 
was ſatisfied with an oftentatious diſplay 
of pleatures and of power, and thoughtleſ 
of the conſequence of diſſipation, was con- 
tented with the pleaſures of the moment, till 
luis exhauſted refources compelled him to 
pauſe, and to reflect. He perceived, too 
late for his advantage, that it was neceſſar) 
for him to diſpoſe of part of his eſtate, and 
to confine himſelf to the income of the re- 
mainder. Ipcapable of ſubmitting with 
grace to the reduction, which his folly 
had rendered expedient, he endeavoured 
to obtain by cunning, the luxuries that 
lus prudence had failed to keep, and which 
neither his genius or his integrity could 
command. He withdrew, however, from 
the eyes of his neighbours, unwilling to 

ſubmit 


( 2721 ) 
ſubmit his altered circumſtances to their 
obſervation. 

Concerning ſeveral years of his life, 
from this period, nothing was generally 
known; and, whenhe was next diſcovered, 
it was in the Spirito Santo convent at 
Naples, in the habit of a Monk, and under 
the aſſumed name of Schedoni. His air 
and countenance were as much altered as 
his way of life; his looks had become 
gloomy and ſevere, and the pride, which 
had mingled with the gaiety of their for- 
mer expreſſion, occaſionally diſcovered it- 
ſelf under the diſguiſe of humility, but 
more frequently in the auſterity of ſilence, 
and in the barbarity of penance. 

The perſon who diſcovered Schedoni, 


would not have recollected him, had not 


his remarkable eyes firſt fixed his atten- 
tion, and then revived remembrance. As 


he examined his features, he traced the 


faint reſemblance of what Marinella had 
been, to whom he made himſelf known.

Ihe Confeſſor affected to have forgotten 
tus former acquaintance, and aſſured him. 
that he was miſtaken reſpecting himſelt, 
till the ſtranger fo cloſely urged ſome cir- 
cumitances, that the former was no longer 
permitted to diſſemble. He retired, in 
ſome emotion, with the ſtranger, and, 
whatever might be the ſubject of their con- 
tcrence, he drew from him, before he quit- 
ted the convent, a tremendous vow, to 
keep ſecret from the brotherhood his 
knowledge of Schedoni's family, and never 
to reveal, without thoſe walls, that he had 
ſeen him. Theſe requeſts he had urged 
in a manner, that at once ſurpriſed and 
awed the ſtranger, and which at the ſame 
time that it manifeſted the weight of Sche- 
doni's fears, bade the former tremble for 
the conſequence of diſobedience; and he 
ſnuddered even while he promiſed to obcy. 
Of the firſt part of the promiſe he was 
probably ſtrictly obſervant; whether he 
was equally ſo of the ſecond, does not ap-

pear ; it is certain, that, after this period, 


he was never more ſeen or heard of at 
Naples. 

Schedoni, ever ambitious of diſtinction, 
adapted his manners to the views and pre- 
judices of the ſociety with whom he reſid- 
ed, and became one of the moſt exact ob- 
ſervers of their outward forms, and almoſt 
a prodigy for (elf-demal and ſevere diſci- 
pline. He was pointed out by the fathers 
of the convent to the juniors as a great 
example, who was, however, rather to be 
looked up to with reverential admiration, 
than with an hope of emulating his ſublime 
virtues. But with ſuch panegyrics their 
friendſhip for Schedoni concluded. They 
found it convenient to applaud the auſte- 
rities, which they declined to practiſe; it 
procured them a character for ſanctity, 
and ſaved them the neceſſity of earning 
it by mortifications of their own ; but 
they both feared and hated Schedoni for 
his pride and his gloomy auſterities, too

much, to gratify his ambition by any thing 
further than empty praiſe. He had been 
ſeveral years in the ſociety, without obtain- 
ing any conſiderable advancement, andwith 
the mortification of ſeeing perſons, who 
had never emulated his ſeverity, raiſed to 
higli offices in the church. Somewhat too 
late he diſcovered, that he was not to ex- 
pect any ſubſtantial favour from the bro- 
therhood, and then it was that his reſtleſs 
and diſappointed ſpirit firſt ſought prefer- 
ment by other avenues. He had been 
{ome time Confeſſor to the Marcheſa di 
Vivaldi, when the conduct of her ſon 
awakened his hopes, by ſhowing him, that 
he might render himſelf not only uſeful 
but neceſſary to her, by his councils. It 
was his cuſtom to ſtudy the characters of 
thoſe around him, witha view of adapting 
them to his purpoſes, and, having aſcer- 
tained that of the Marcheſa, theſe hopes 
were encouraged. He perceived that her 
paſſions were ſtrong, her judgment weak; 


and

and he underſtood, that, if circumſtances 
ſhould ever enable him to be ſerviceable 
in promoting the end at wiuch any one of 
thoſe paſſions might aim, his fortune 
would be eſtabliſhed. | 

At length, he ſo completely infinuated 
himſelf into her confidence, and became 
fo neceſſary to her views, that he could de- 
mand his own terms, and this he had not 
failed todo, though with all the affected de- 
hcacy and fineſſe that his ſituation ſeemed 
to require. An office of high dignity in the 
church, which had long vainly excited his 
ambition, was promiſed him by the Mar- 
cheſa, who had ſufficient influence to ob- 
tainit; her condition was that of his preſerv- 
ing the honour ofher family, as ſhe delicately 
termed it, which ſhe was careful to make 
him underſtand could be ſecured onlybythe 
death of Ellena. He acknowledged, with 
the Marcheſa, that the death of this faſci- 
nating young woman was the only means of 
preſerving that honour, nde, if he lived,

they had every evil to expect from the at- 
tachment and character of Vivaldi, who 
would diſcover and extricate her from any 
place of confinement, however obſcure or 
difficult of acceſs, to which ſhe might be 
conveyed. How long and how arduouſly 
the Confeſſor had aimed tooblige the Mar- 
cheſa, has already appeared. The laſt 
ſcene was now arrived, and he was on the 
eve of committing that atrocious act, 
which was to ſecure the pride of her houſe, 
and to ſatisfy at once his ambition and his 
deſire of vengeance, when an emotion new 
and ſurpriſing to him, had arreſted his 
arm, and compelled his reſolution to fal- 
ter. But this emotion was tranſient, it 
diſappeared almoſt with the object that 
had awakened it; and now, in the ſilence 
and retirement of his chamber, he had lei- 
ſure to recollect his thoughts, to review his 
ſchemes, to re- animate his reſolution, and 
to wonder again at the pity which had al- 
moſt won him from his purpoſe. The 
ruling 


( 277 ) 
ruling paſſion of his nature once more re- 
ſumed its authority, and he determined to 
earn the honour which the Marcheſa had 
in ſtore for him. 

After ſome cool, and more of tumultuous 
conſideration, he reſolved that Ellena ſhould 
be aſſaſſinated that night, while ſhe ſlept, 
and afterwards conveyed through a paſſage 
of the houſe communicating with the ſea, 
into which the body might be thrown and 
buried, with her ſad ſtory, beneath the 
waves. For his own ſake he would have 

| avoided the danger of ſhedding blood, 
had this appeared eafy; but he had too 
much reaſon to know ſhe had ſuſpicions 
of poiſon, to truſt to a ſecond attempt by 
fuch means ; and again his indignation 
roſe againſt himſelf, ſince by yielding to a 
momentary compaſſion, he had loſt the 
opportunity afforded him of throwing her 
unreſiſtingly into the ſurge. 

Spalatro, as has already been hinted, ( 


was a former confident of the Confeſſor,

who knew too truly, from experience, that 
he could be truſted, and had, therefore, 
engaged him to affiſt on this occaſion. To 
the hands of this man he conſigned the 
fate of the unhappy Ellena, himſelf recoil- 
ing from the horrible act he had willed; 
and intending by ſuch a ſtep to involve 
Spalatro more deeply in the guilt, and 
thus more effectually to ſecure his ſecret, 
The night was far advanced before 
Schedoni's final reſolution was taken, when 
he ſummoned Spalatro to his chamber to 
inſtru&amp; him in his office. He bolted the 
door, by which the man had entered, for- 
getting that themſelves were the only per- 
{ons in the houſe, except the poor Ellena, 
who, unſuſpicious of what was conſpiring, 
and her ſpirits worn out by the late ſcene, 
was ſleeping peacefully on her mattreſs 
above. Schedoni moved ſoftly from the 
door he had ſecured, and, beckoning Spa- 
latro to approach, {poke in a low voice, 
as if he feared to be overheard. © Have 
you 


„ 


you perceived any ſound from her cham- 


ber lately?“ ſaid he, Does ſhe ſleep, 
think you?“ 

No one has moved there for this hour 
paſt, at leaſt,” replied Spalatro, I have 
been watching in the corridor, till you 
called, and ſhould have heard if ſhe had 
ſtirred, the old floor ſhakes ſo with every 
ſtep.” | 

Then hear me, Spalatro,” ſaid the 
Confeſſor. I have tried, and found thee 


faithful, or I ſhould not truſt thee in a 


buſineſs of confidence like this. Recollect 
all I ſaid to thee in the morning, and be 
reſolute and dexterous, as I have ever 
found thee.” 

Spalatro liſtened in gloomy attention, 
and the Monk proceeded, “ It is late; 
go, therefore, to her chamber; be certain 
that ſhe ſleeps. Take this,” he added, 
and this,” giving him a dagger and a 
large cloak—* You know how you are to 
ule them.“

He pauſed, and fixed his penetrating 
eyes on Spalatro, who held up the dagger 
in ſilence, examined the blade, and conti- 
nued to gaze upon it, with a vacant ſtare, 
as if he was unconſcious of what he did, 

« You know your buſineſs,” repeated 
Schedoni, authoritatively,“ diſpatch! time 
wears; and I muſt ſet off early.” 

The man made no reply. | 

The morning dawns already,“ ſaid the 
Confeffor, {till more urgently, © Do you. 
falter ? do you tremble? Do I not know 
you?“ 

Spalatro put up the poniard in his bo- 
ſom without ſpeaking, threw the cloak 
over his arm, and moved with a loitering 
ſtep towards the door. 

« Diſpatch !”” repeated the Confeſſor, 
« why do you linger?“ 

« cannot ſay I like this buſineſs, 
Signor,“ ſaid Spalatro furlily. © I know 
not why I ſhould always do the moſt, and 
be paid the leaſt,” ? 


“ Sordick

« Sordid villain !”” exclaimed Schedoni, 
you are not ſatisfied then!“ 

« No more a villain than yourſelf, 
Signor,“ retorted the man, throwing down 
the cloak, I only do your buſineſs ; and 
'tis you that are ſordid, for you would 
take all the reward, and I would only have 
a poor man have his dues. Do the work

myſelf! *Tis my will that ſhe dies; 
this is ſufficient ; and for you—the price

« It is too little,” replied Spalatro, and 
beſides, I do not like the work. — What 
harm has ſhe done me?“ 

Since when 1s it that you have taken 
upon you to moralize?” ſaid the Con- 
teflor, © and how long are theſe cowardly

know you, you forget the paſt.” 

No, Signor, I remember it too well, 
wifh I could forget; I remember it too 
well. —I have never been at peace ſince. 
The bloody hand is always before me 
and often of a night, when the ſea roars, 
and ſtorms ſhake the houſe, hey have 
come, all gaſhed as I left them, and ſtood 
before my bed! I have got up, and ran 
Tut upon the ſhore for ſafety: 

« Peace!” repeated the Confeſſor, 
here is this frenzy of fear to end? To 
what are theſe viſions, painted in blood, to 
lead? I thought I was talking with a 
man, but find I am ſpeaking only to a 
baby, poſſeſſed with his nurſe's dreams ! 
Tet I underſtand you, — you ſhall be ſa- 
tisfied.” 

Schedoni, however, had for once miſun- 
deritood this man, when he could not be- 
lieve it poſſible that he was really averſe to 
execute what he had undertaken. Whe- 

ther 


( 283 ) 
ther the innocence and beauty of Ellena 
had ſoftened his heart, or that his con- 
ſcience did torture him for his paſt deeds, 
he perſiſted in refuſing to murder her. 
His conſcience, or his pity, was of a very 
peculiar kind however; for, though he re- 
fuſed to execute the deed himſelf, he con- 
ſented to wait at the foot of aback ſtair- caſe, 
that communicated with Ellena's chamber, 
while Schedoni accompliſhed it, ard after- 
ward to aſſiſt in carrying the body to the 
ſhore. © This is a compromiſe between 
conſcience and guilt, worthy of a demon,” 
muttered Schedoni, who appeared to be 
inſenſible that he had made the ſame com- 
promiſe with himſelf not an hour before 
and whoſe extreme reluctance at this mo- 


ment, to perpetrate with his own hand, 


what he had willingly deſigned for ano- 
ther, ought to have reminded him of that 
compromiſe. 


Spalatro, releaſed from the immediate 
office of an executioner, endured ſilently

the abuſive, yet half-ſtifled, indignation 
of the Confeſſor, who allo bade him re- 
member, that, though he now ſhrunk from 
the moſt active part of this tranſaction, he 
had not always been reſtrained, in offices of 
the ſame nature, by equal compunction; 
and that not only his means of ſubſiſtence, 
but his very life itſelf, was at his mercy, 
Spalatro readily acknowledged that it was 
ſo; and Schedoni knew too well, the 
truth of what he had urged, to be re- 
ſtrained from his purpoſe, by any appre- 
henſion of the conſequence of a diſcovery 
from this ruffian. 

* Give me the dagger, then,” ſaid the 
Confeſſor, after a long paule, © take up the 
cloak, and follow to the ſtair-caſe. Let me 
ſee, whether your valour will carry you 
thus far.” 

Spalatro reſigned the ſtiletto, and threw 
the cloak again over his arm. The Con- 
ſeſſor ſtepped to the door, and, trying to 
open it, © It is faſtened !” ſaid he in alarm, 

* {ome 


(- 203 --3 
« ſome perſon has got into the houſe 
it is faſtened !” 

« That well may be, Signor,“ replied 
Spalatro, calmly, * for I ſaw you bolt it 
yourſelf, after I came into the room.“ 

True,“ ſaid Schedoni, recovering 
him; © that is true.“ 

He opened it, and proceeded along the 
ſilent paſſages, towards the private ſtair- 
caſe, often pauſing to liſten, and then 
ſtepping more lightly ;—the terrific Sche- 
doni, in this moment of meditative guilt, 
feared even the feeble Ellena. At the 
foot of the ſtair- caſe, he again ſtopped to 
liſten. Do you hear any thing?“ ſaid 
he in a whiſper. 

« T hear only the ſea,” replied the man. 

** Huſh! it is ſomething more!“ ſaid 
Schedoni; *© that is the murmur of 
voices!“ 

They were ſilent. After a pauſe of 
{ome length, © It is, perhaps, the voice of 
the ſpectres I told you of, Signor,“ ſaid 

Spalatro, 


( 286 ) 


Spalatro, with a ſneer. Give me the 
dagger,” ſaid Schedoni. 

Spalatro, inſteed of obeying, now graſp- 
ed the arm of the Confeſſor, who, looking 
at him for an explanation of this extraor- 
dinary action, was {till more ſurpriſed to 
obſerve the paleneſsand horror of his coun- 
tenance. His ſtarting eyes ſeemed to fol- 
low ſome object along the paſſage, and 
Schedoni, who began topartake of his feel- 
ings, looked forward to diſcover what oc- 
caſioned this diſmay, but could not per- 
ceive any thing that juſtified it. What 
is it you fear?“ ſaid he at length. 

Spalatro's eyes were ſtill moving in hor- 
ror, Do you ſee nothing!“ ſaid he point- 
ing. Schedoni looked again, but did not 
diſtinguiſh any object in the remote gloom 
of the paſſage, whither Spalatro's ſight was 
now fixed. 

* Come, come,“ ſaid he, aſhamed of 
his own weakneſs, © this is not a moment 
for ſuch fancies. Awake from this idle 
dream.“ 


Spalatro 


( 287 ) 

Spalatro withdrew his eyes, but they 
retained all their wildneſs. © It was no 
dream,” ſaid he, in the voice of a man 
who is exhauſted by pain, and begins to 
breathe ſomewhat more freely again. I 
ſaw it as plainly as I now ſee you.”

ed the Confeſſor.

ment, and ſhewed itſelf diſtinctly and out- | 1

Schedoni, ſhocked, embarraſſed, and 
once more infected with the ſtrange emo- 
tions of Spalatro, looked forward expect- 
ing to diſcover ſome terrific object, but ſtill 
nothing was vifible to him, and he ſoon 
recovered himſelf ſufficiently to endeavour 
to appeaſe the fancy of this conſcience- 
ſtruck ruffian. But Spalatro was inſen— 
ſible to all he could urge, and the Con- 
feflor, fearing that his voice, though weak 
and ſtifled, would awaken Ellena, tried to 
| withdraw him from the ſpot, to the apart- 
ment they had quitted. 

The wealth of San Loretto ſhould not 
make me go that way, Signor,“ replied he, 
ſhuddering—“ that was the way 7 beck- 
oned, it vaniſhed that way!“ 

Every emotion now yielded with Sche- 
doni, to that of apprehenſion leſt Ellena, 
being awakened, ſhould make his tak 
more horrid by a ſtruggle, and his embar- 
raſſment encreaſed at each inſtant, for nei-

luckily remembered a door, which opened 


beyond the ſtair- caſe, and would condud 


them by another way to the oppoſite

ſv to depart, when, Schedoni unlock- 
ing a ſuit of rooms, of which he had 
always kept the keys, they paſſed in filence 
through an extent of deſolate chambers, 
till they reached the one which they had 
lately left. 

Here, relieyed from apprehenſion re- 
{petting Ellena, the Confeſſor expoſtulat- 
ed more freely with Spalatro, but neither 
argument or menace could prevail, and the 


man perſiſted in refuſing to return to the 


ſtair-caſe, though proteſting, at the ſame 
time, that he would not remain alone in 
any part of the houſe ; till the wine, with 
which the Confeſſor abundantly ſupplied 
him, began to overcome the terrors of his 
imagination, At length, his courage was 
ſo much re- animated, that he conſented to

had lately paſſed. The wine, with which 
Schedoni alſo had found it neceſſary to

made a ſtrenuous effort for ſelf- ſubjec-

Schedoni took it angrily, without ſpeak-

ſitated, and once more pauſed. The

Again he aſcended, nor ſtopped till he 
reached Ellena's door, where he liſtened 
for a ſound; but all was as ſilent as if 
death already reigned in the chamber.

yielded without ſound, but now Schedoni 
was fearful of noiſe from every effort he 
made to move it. After ſome difficulty, 
however, it gave way, and he perceived, 
by the ſtillneſs within the apartment, that 
he bad not diſturbed Ellena. He ſhaded 
the lamp with the door for a moment, 
while he threw an enquiring glance for- 
ward, and when he did venture further, 
held part of his dark drapery before the 
light, to prevent the rays from ſpreading 
through the room. 

As he approached the bed, her gentle 
breathings informed him that ſhe till 
ſlept, and the next moment he was at her 
ſide. She lay in deep and peaceful ſlum- 
ber, and ſeemed to have thrown herlelt 
upon the mattreſs, after having been wea- 
ried by her griefs; for, though fleep preſ- 
ſed heavily on her eyes, their lids were yet 
wet with tears, 

While Schedoni gazed for a moment 
upon her innocent countenance, a faint 

{mule

ſmile ſtole over it. He ſtepped back. She 
ſmiles in her murderer's. face !” ſaid he, 
ſhuddering, © I muſt be ſpeedy.” 
He ſearched for the dagger, and it was 


ſome time before lus trembling hand could 


diſengage it from the folds of his garment; 
but, having done ſo, he again drew near, 
and prepared to ſtrike. Her dreſs perplex- 
ed him ; it would interrupt the blow, and 
he ſtooped to examine whether he could 
turn her robe afide, without waking her. 
As the light paſſed over her face, he per- 
ceived that the ſmile had vaniſhed—the 
viſions of her ſleep were changed, for tears 
ſtole from beneath her eye-lids, and her 
features ſuffered a ſlight convulſion. She 
ſpoke! Schedoni, apprehending that the 
light had diſturbed her, ſuddenly drew 
back, and, again irreſolute, ſhaded the 
lamp, and concealed himſelf behind the 
curtain, while he liſtened. But her words 


were inward and indiſtinct, and con- 


vinced him that ſhe ſtill ſlumbered.

His agitation and repugnance to ſtrike 
encreaſed withevery moment of delay, and, 
as often as he prepared to plunge the po- 
niard in her boſom, a ſhuddering horror 
reſtrained him. Aſtoniſhed at his own 
feelings, and indignant at what he terme{ 
a daſtardly weakneſs, he found it neceſſary 
to argue with himſelf, and his rapid 
thoughts ſaid, © Do I not feel the neceſſity 
of this act? Does not what is dearer to 
me than exiſtence—does not my conle- 
quence depend on the execution of it? Is 
ſhe. not alſo beloved by the young Vival- 
di? have I already forgotten the church 
of the Spirito Santo ? This conſideration 
re· animated him; vengeance nerved his 
arm, and drawing aſide the lawn from her 
boſom, he once more railed it to ſtrike ; 
when, after gazing foran inſtant, ſome new 
cauſe of horror ſeemed to ſeize all his frame, 
and he ſtood for ſome moments aghalt 
and motionleſs like a ſtatue. His reſpi- 


ration was ſhort and laborious, chilly drops 
ſtood 


( 295 ) 

ſtood on his forehead, and all his faculties 
of mind ſeemed ſuſpended. When he re- 
covered, he ſtooped to examine again the 
munature, which had occaſioned this revo— 
lution, and which had lain concealed be- 
neath the lawn that he withdrew. The 
terrible certainty was almoſt confirmed, 
and forgetting, in his impatience to know 
the truth, the imprudence of ſuddenly diſ- 
covering himſelf to Ellena at this hour of 
the night, and with a dagger at his feet, 
he called loudly “ Awake ! awake ! Say, 
what is your name? Speak ! ſpeak quick- 
ly!“ 

Ellena, arouſed by a man's voice, ſtart- 
ed from her mattreſs, when, perceiving 
Schedoni, and by the pale glare of the 
lamp, lus haggard countenance, ſhe ſhriek- 
ed, and ſunk back on the pillow. She had 
not fainted; and believing that he came 
to murder her, ſhe now exerted herſelf to 
plead for mercy. The energy of her feelings 
enabled her to riſe and throw herſelf at

his feet, © Be merciful, O father be merci- 
ful!“ faid ſhe, in a trembling voice. 

« Father!” interrupted Schedoni, with 
earneſtneſs ; and then, ſeeming to reſtrain 
himſelf, he added, with unaffected {ur- 
priſe, « Why are you thus terrified?” for he 
had loſt, in new intereſts and emotions, all 
conſciouſneſs of evil intention, and of the 
ſingularity of his ſituation. What do 
you fear?“ he repeated. 

* Have pity, holy father!“ exclaimed 
Ellena in agony. Fi 

Why do you not ſay whole portrait 
that is?“ demanded he, forgetting that 
he had not aſked the queſtion before. 

** Whoſe portrait?“ repeated the Con- 
feſſor in a loud voice. 

* Whole portrait!“ ſaid Ellena, with 
extreme ſurpriſe. 

* Ay, how came you by it? Be quick 
—whoſle reſemblance is it?“ 

„ Why ſhould you with to know?“ 


faid Ellena. 
« Anſwer 


( 297 ) 
. * Anſwer my queſtion,” repeated Sche- 
dont, with encreafing ſternneſs. 

“cannot part with it, holy father,” 
replied Ellena, preſſing it to her boſom, 
« you do not with me to part with 
"I ah 

Is it impoſſible to make you anſwer my 

queſtion !” ſaid he, in extreme perturba- 

tion, and turning away from her, “ has 
fear utterly confounded you! Then, 
again ſtepping towards her, and ſeizing 
her wriſt, he repeated the demand in a 
tone of deſperation. 

Alas! he is dead ! orI ſhould not now 
want a protector,” replied Ellena, ſhrink- 
ing from his graſp, and weeping. 

Tou trifle,” ſaid Schedoni, with a 
terrible look, „I once more demand an 
anſwer—whoſe picture?“ 

Ellena lifted it, gazed upon it for a 
moment, and then preſſing it to her lips 
{aid, “ This was my father.” 

«Your father!“ he repeated in an inward 

O 5 Voice, 


( 298 ) 
voice, © your father!“ and ſhuddering, 
turned away. | 

Ellena looked at him with ſurpriſe. 
J never knew a father's care,“ ſhe ſaid, 
* nor till lately did I perceive the want of 
it, —But now.” —— 

His name?“ interrupted the Con- 
feſſor. 

« But now” continued Ellena “ if you 
are not as a father to me to whom can! 
look for protection?“ 

His name? © repeated Schedoni, with 
ſterner emphaſis. 

It is ſacred,” replied Ellena,“ for he 
was unfortunate !” 

« His name ?” demanded the Confeſſor, 
furiouſly. 

« I have promiſed to concealit, father.” 

« On your life, I charge you tell it; 
remember, on your life!“ 

Ellena trembled, was filent, and with 
ſupplicating looks implored him to deſiſt 
from enquiry; but he urged the queſtion 

more 


( 299 ) 
more irrefiſtibly. © His name then,” ſaid 
ſhe, was Marinella.“ 

Schedoni groaned and turned away; 
but in a few ſeconds, ſtruggling to com- 
mand the agitation that ſhattered his 
whole frame, he returned to Ellena, and 
raiſed her from her knees, on which ſhe 
had thrown herſelf to implore mercy. 

„The place of his reſidence ?” ſaid the 
Monk. 

It was far from hence,” ſhe replied; but 
he demanded an unequiyocal anſwer, and 
ſhe reluctantly gave one. 

Schedoni turned away as before, groan- 
ed heavily, and paced the chamber witb- 
out ſpeaking ; while Ellena, in her turn, 
enquired the motive of his queſtions, and. 
the occaſion of his agitation, But he 
leemed not to notice any thing ſhe ſaid, 
and, wholly given. up to his feelings, was 
inflexibly ſilent, while he ſtalked, with 
meaſured ſteps, along the room, and his 
tace, halt hid by his cowl, was bent towards 
the ground, 

0 6 Ellena's. 


( 300 ) 

Ellena's terror began to yield toaſtoniſh- 
ment, and this emotion encreaſed, when, 
Schedoni approaching her, ſhe perceived 
tears {well in his eyes, which were fixt on 
her's, and his countenance {often from the 
wild diforder that had marked it. Still 
he could not ſpeak. At length he yielded 
to the fulneſs of his heart, and Schedoni, 
the ſtern Sehedoni, wept and ſighed 
He ſeated himſelf on the mattreſs beſide 
Ellena, took her hand, which ſhe, af— 
frighted, attempted to withdraw, and 
when he could command his voice, ſaid, 
« Unhappy child ! behold your more 
unhappy father!“ As he concluded, his 


voice was overcome by groans, and he drew | 


the cowl entirely over his face. 

« My father!” exclaimed the aſtoniſhed 
and doubting Ellena—“ my father!“ and 
fixed her eyes upon him. He gave no 
reply, but when, a moment after, he lifted 
his head, Why do you reproach me with 
thoſe looks 1” {aid the conſciouꝭ Schedoni. 

« Reproach 


(+303 
© Reproach you !—reproach my fa- 
ther!“ repeated Ellena, in accents ſoften- 
ing into tenderneſs, * iy ſhould I re- 
proach my father!“ 

My!“ exclaimed Schedoni, ſtarting 
from his ſeat, © Great God!“ 

As he moved, he ſtumbled over the dag- 
ger at his foot; at that moment it might 
be ſaid to ſtrike into his heart. He puſhed 
it haſtily from fight. Ellena had not ob- 
ſerved it; but ſhe obſerved his labouring 
breaſt, his diſtracted countenance, and quick 
ſteps, as he again walked to and ſro in the 
chamber; and ſhe aſked, with the moſt 
ſoothing accents of compaſſion, and looks 
of anxious gentleneſs, what made him ſo 
unhappy, and tried to aſſauge his ſuffer- 
ings. They ſeemed to increaſe with every 
- wiſh ſhe expreſſed to diſpel them; at one 
moment he would pauſe to gaze upon her, 
and in the next would quit her with a 
frenzied ſtart. 

« Why do you look ſo piteouſly upon 

| me, 


(6 302 3} 

me, father ?” Ellena ſaid, why are you 
ſo unhappy ? Tell me, that I may com- 
fort you.” | 

This appeal renewed all the violence of 
remorſe and grief, and he preſſed her to his 
boſom, and wetted her cheek with his. 
tears. Ellena wept to fee him weep, till 
her doubts began to take alarm. What- 
ever might be the proofs, that had con- 
vinced Schedoni of the relationſhip be- 
tween them, he had not explained theſe to 
her, and, however ſtrong was the eloquence 
of nature which ſhe witneſſed, it was not. 
ſufficient to juſtify an entire confidence in 
the aſſertion he had made, or to allow her 
to permit his careſſes without trembling. 
She ſhrunk, and endeavoured to diſengage 
herſelf; when, immediately underſtanding 
her, be ſaid, © Can you doubt the cauſe of 
theſe emotions ? theſe ſigns of paternal, 
affection?“ 

Have I not reaſon to doubt,” replied 
Ellena, timidly, © ſince I never witneſſed 
them before?“ 


Fic 


( 303 } 

He withdrew his arms, and, fixing his 
eyes earneſtly on her's, regarded her for 
ſome moments in expreſſive filence. 
Poor Innocent!“ ſaid he, at length, 
« you know not how much your words 
convey !—It is too true, you never 
have known a father's tenderneſs till 
now!“ 

His countenance darkened while he 
ſpoke, and he roſe again from his ſeat. 
Elena, meanwhile, aſtoniſhed, terrified 
and oppreſſed by à variety of emotions, 
had no power to demand his reaſons for 
the belief that ſo much agitated him, or 
any explanation of his conduct; but ſhe 
appealed to the portrait, and endeavoured, 
by tracing ſome” reſemblance between it 
and Schedoni, to decide her doubts. 
The countenance of each was as diffe- 
rent in character as in years. The mi- 
niature diſplayed a young man rather 
handſome, of a gay and ſmiling coun- 
tenance; yet the {mule expreſſed triumph, 
rather

( 304 ) 

rather than ſweetneſs, and his whole air 
and features were diſtinguiſhed by a con- 
ſciouſneſs of ſuperiority that role even to 
haughtineſs. 

Schedoni, on the contrary, advanced in 
years, exhibited a ſevere phyfiognomy, 
furrowed by thought, no leſs than by 
time, and darkened by the habitual in- 
dulgence of moroſe paſſions. He looked 
as if he had never ſmiled fince the por- 
trait was drawn; and it {ſeemed as if the 


painter, prophetic of Schedoni's future 


diſpoſition, had arreſted and embodied 
that ſmile, to prove hereafter that cheer- 
fulneſs had once played upon his fea- 
tures. 

Though the expreſſion was ſo different, 
between the countenance which Schedoni 
formerly owned, and that he now wore, 
the ſame character of haughty pride was 
viſible in both; and Ellena did trace a 
reſemblance in the bold outline of the 
features, but not ſufficient to convince 


ker, 


( 30 

her, without further evidence, that each 
belonged to the ſame perſon, and that 
the Confeſſor had ever been the young 
cavalier in the portrait. In the firſt 
tumult of her thoughts, ſhe had not had 
leiſure to dwell upon the ſingularity of 
Schedoni's viſiting her at this deep hour 
of the night, or to urge any queſtions, ex- 
cept vague ones, concerning the truth of 
her relationſhip to him. But now, that 
her mind was ſomewhat recollected, and 
that his looks were leſs terrific, ſhe ven- 
tured to aſk a fuller explanation of theſe 
circumſtances, and his reaſons for the 
late extraordinary aſſertion. It is paſt 
midnight, father,” ſaid Ellena, “ you 
may judge then how anxious I am to 
learn, what motive led you to my cham- 
ber at this lonely hour?“ 

Schedoni made no reply. 

« Did you come to warn me of 
danger?“ ſhe continued, © had you diſ- 


covered the cruel deſigns of Spalatro ?

Ah! when I ſupplicated for your com- 
paſſion on the ſhore this evening, you 
little thought what perils ſurrounded 


me! or you would 2 


« You fay true!“ interrupted he, in 
a hurried manner, but name the ſub- 
ject no more. Why will you perſiſt in 
returning to it?“ 

His words ſurprized Ellena, who had 
not even alluded to the ſubject till now; 
but the returning wildneſs of his coun- 
tenance, made her fearful of dwelling 
upon the topic, even ſo far as to point 
out his error. 

Another deep pauſe ſucceeded, during 
which Schedom continued to pace the 
room, ſometimes ſtopping for an inſtant, 
to fix his eyes on Ellena, and regarding 
her with an earneſtneſs that ſeemed to 
partake of phrenzy, and then gloomily 
withdrawing his regards, and ſighing 
heavily, as he turned away to a diſtant 
part of the room, She, meanwhile, agi- 
tated

tated with aſtoniſhment at his conduct, 
as well as at her own circumſtances, and 
with the fear of offending him by further 
queſtions, endeavoured toſummon courage 
to ſolicit the explanation which was ſo 
important to her tranquillity. At length 
ſhe aſked, how ſhe might venture to be- 
heve a circumſtance to ſurpriſing, as that 
of which he had juſt aſſured her, and to 
remind him that he had not yet diſcloſed 
his reaſon for admitting the belief. 

The Confeſſor's feelings were eloquent 
in reply; and, when at length they were 
ſufficiently ſubdued, to permit him to 
talk coherently, he mentioned ſome cir- 
cumſtances concerning Ellena's family, 
that proved him at leaſt to have been 
intimately acquainted with it; and others, 
which ſhe believed were known only to 
Bianchi and herſelf, that removed every 
doubt of his identity. 

This, however, was a period of his 
life too big with remorſe, horror, and 
tho 


( 308 ) 


the firſt pangs of parental affection, to 
allow him to converſe long; deep ſoli- 
tude was neceflary for his foul. He | 


wiſhed to plunge where no eye might 
reſtrain his emotions, or obſerve the 
overflowing anguith of his heart. Har- 
ing obtained ſufficient proof to convince 
him that Ellena was indeed his child, 
and aſſured her that ſhe ſhould be re- 
moved from this houſe on the follow- 
ing day, and be reſtored to her home, 
he abruptly left the chamber. 

As he deſcended the ſtair-caſe, Spa- 
latro ſtepped forward to meet him, with 
the cloak which had been deſigned to 
wrap the mangled form of Ellena, when 
it ſhould be carried to the ſhore. Is 
it done?“ ſaid the ruffian, in a ſtifled 
voice, © I am ready;” and he ſpread 
forth the cloak, and began to aſcend. 

„Hold! villain, hold!“ ſaid Schedoni, 
lifting up his head for the firſt time, 
* Dare to enter that chamber, and your 
life ſhall anſwer for it.“ 

„ What!” 


in

„„ 

« What !” exciaimed the man, ſhrink- 
ing back aſtoniſhed “ will not her's ſa- 
tisfy you!“ | 

He trembled for the conſequence of 
what he had ſaid, when he obſerved the 
changing countenance of the Confeſſor. 
But Schedoni ſpoke not: the tumult in 
his breaſt was too great for utterance, and 
he preſſed haſtily forward. Spalatro fol- 
lowed. *© Be pleaſed to tell me what I 
am to do,“ {aid he, again holding forth the 
cloak. 

« Avaunt !” exclaimed the other, turn- 
ing fiercely upon him ; © leave me.” 

« How !” faid the man, whole ſpirit was 
now arouſed, © has your courage failed too, 
Signor? If fo, I will prove myſelf no daſ- 
tard, though you called me one; I'll do 
the buſineſs myſelf.” 

Villain! fiend !” cried Schedoni, ſeiz- 
ing the ruffian by the throat, with a graſp 
that ſeemed intended to annihilate him;

had himſelf but lately delivered to him, | 
other emotions ſucceeded to that of rage; 
he ſlowly liberated him, and in accents | 


broken, and ſoftening from ſternneſs, bade 
him retire to reſt. © Tomorrow,” he add- 
ed, “I will ſpeak further with you. As 
for this night I have changed my pur- 
poſe. Begone!“ 

Spalatro was about to expreſs the in- 
dignation, whichaſtoniſhment and tear had 
hitherto overcome ; but his employer re- 
peated his command in a voice of thun- 
der, and cloſed the door of his apartment 
with violence, as he ſhut out a man, whoſe 
preſence was become hateful to hum. He 
felt reheved by his abſence, and began to 
breathe more freely, till, remembering that 
this accomplice had juſt boaſted that he 
was no daſtard, he dreaded left, by way of 
proving the affertion, he ſhould attempt 
to commit the crime, from which he had 
lately ſhrunk. Terrified at the poſſibili-

ty, and even apprehending that it might 
already have become a reality, he ruſhed 
from the room, and found Spalatro in the 


paſſage leading to the private ſtair-caſe ; 


but, whatever might have been his pur- 
pole, the fituation and looks of the latter 
were ſufficiently alarming. At the ap- 
proach of Schedoni, he turned his ſullen 
and malignant countenance towards him, 
without anſwering the call, or the demand 
as to his buſineſs there; and with flow 
ſteps obeyed the order of his maſter, that 
he ſhould withdraw to his room. Thither 
Schedoni followed, and, having locked him 
in it for the night, he repaired to the apart- 
ment of Ellena, which he ſecured from the 
poſſibility of intruſion. He then returned 
to his own, not to ſleep, but to abandon 
himſelf to the agonies of remorſe and hor- 
ror ; and he yet ſhuddered, like a man who 
has juſt recoiled from the brink of a pre- 


cipice, and who ſtill meaſures the gulf with 


his eye.

Mirror, 


ETLENA, when Schedoni had left her. 
recollected all the particulars, which he 
had thought proper to reveal concerning 
her family, and, comparing them with ſuch 
circumſtances as the late Bianchi had re- 
lated on the fame ſubject, ſhe perceived 
nothing that was contradictory between the 


two accounts. But ſhe knew not even yet 


enough of her own ſtory, to underſtand 
why Bianchi had been filent as to ſome 
particulars, which had juſt been diſcloſed. 
From Bianchi ſhe had always underſtood, 
that her mother had married a nobleman 
of the duchy of Milan, and of the houſe of 
of | Mari- 


636 

Marinella; that the marriage had been 
unfortunate; and that ſhe herſelf, even 
before the death of the Counteſs, had been 
Veommitted to the care of Bianchi, the only 

ſiſter of that lady. Of this event, or of 
her mother, Ellena had no remembrance; 
for the kindneſs of Bianchi had obliterated 
from her mind the loſs and the griefs of 
her early infancy; and ſhe recollected 
only the accident which had diſcovered 
to her, in Bianchi's cabinet, after the 
death of the latter, the miniature and 
the name of her father. When ſhe 
had enquired the reaſon of this injunc- 
tion, Bianchi replied, that the degrad- 
ed fortune of her houſe rendered pri- 
vacy deſirable; and anſwered her fur- 
ther queſtions concerning her father, by 
relating, that he had died while ſhe was 
an infant. The picture, which Ellena 
had diſcovered, Bianchi had found among 
the trinkets of the departed Counteſs, and

deſigned to preſent it at ſome future pe- 
riod to Ellena, when her diſcretion might 
be truſted with a knowledge of her family. 
This was the whole of what Signora Bian- 
chi had judged 1t neceflary to explain, 
though in her laſt hours it appeared that 
ſhe wiſhed to reveal more ; but 1t was 
then too late. 

Though Ellena perceived that many 
circumſtances of the relations given by 
Schedoni, and by Signora Bianchi, coin- 
cided, and that none were contradictory, 
except that of his death, ſhe could not yet 
ſubdue her amazement at this diſcovery, 
or even the doubts which occaſionally re- 
curred to her as to its truth. Schedoni, 
on the contrary, had not even appeared 
furpriſed, when ſhe aſſured him, that ſhe 
always underſtood her father had been 
dead many years; though when ſhe aſked 
if her mother too was living, both his diſ- 
treſs and his aſſurances confirmed the rela- 
tion made by. Bianchi. 

| When 


( 315 ) 

When Ellena's mind became more tran- 
quil, ſhe noticed again the fingularity of 
Schedoni's viſit to her apartment at ſo ſa- 
cred an hour; and her thoughts glanced 
back involuntarily to the ſcene of the pre- 
ceding evening on the ſea-thore, and the 
image of her father appeared in each, in 
the terrific character of an agent of the 
Marcheſa di Vivaldi. The ſuſpicions, 
however, which ſhe had formerly admit- 
ted, reſpecting his deſigns, were now 1mpa- 
tiently rejected, for ſhe was leſs anxious to 
diſcover truth, than to releaſe herſelf from 
horrible ſuppoſitions ; and ſhe willingly 
believed that Schedoni, having miſunder- 
ſtocd her character, had only deſigned to 
affiſt in removing her beyond the reach of 
Vivaldi. The ingenuity of hope ſuggeſted 
alſo, that, having juſt heard from her con- 
ductors, or from Spalatro, ſome circum- 
ſtances of her ſtory, he had been led to a 
ſuſpicionof the relationſhipbetween them,

and that in the firſt impatience of paren- 
tal anxiety, he had diſregarded the hour, 
and come, though at midnight, to her 
apartment to aſcertain the truth. 

While ſhe ſoothed herſelf with this ex- 
planation of a circumſtance, which had oc- 
caſioned her conſiderable ſurpriſe, ſhe per- 
ceived on the floor the pomt of a dagger 
peeping from beneath the curtain ! Emo- 
tions almoſt too horrible to be ſuſtained, 
followed this diſcovery ; ſhe took the in- 
ftrument, and gazed upon 1t aghaſt and 
trembling, for a ſuſpicion of the real mo- 
tive of Schedoni's viſit glanced upon her 
mind. But it was only for a moment; ſuch 
a {ſuppoſition was too terrible to be willing- 
ly endured ; ſhe again believed that Spa- 
latro alone had meditated her deſtruction, 
and ſhe thanked the Confeſſor as her deli- 
verer, inſtead of ſhrinking from him as an 
aſſaſſin. She now underſtood that Sche- 


doni, having diſcovered the ruffian's deſign, |

had ruſhed into the chamber to ſave a 
ſtranger from his murderous poniard, and 
had unconſciouſly reſcued his own daugh- 
ter, when the portrait at her boſom 1n- 
formed him of the truth. With this 
conviction Ellena's eyes overflowed with 
gratitude, and her heart was huſhed to 
peace. 

Schedoni, meanwhile, ſhut up in his 
chamber, was agitated by feelings of a ve- 
ry oppoſite nature. When their firſt ex- 
ceſs was exhauſted, and his mind was 
calm enough to reflect, the images that 
appeared on it ſtruck him with folemn 
wonder. In purſuing Ellena at the crimi- 
nal inſtigation of the Marcheſa di Vivaldi, 
it appeared that he had been perſecuting 
his own child; and in thus conſenting to 
conſpire againſt the innocent, he had in the 
event been only puniſhing the guilty, and 
preparing mortification for himſelf on the 
exact ſubje&amp; to which he had ſacrificed 
his conſcience. Every ſtep that he had 

P 3 taken 


uo_ —L[—̃ — — 


(-- 6 


taken with a view of gratifying his ambi- 
tion was retrograde, and while he had been 


wickedly intent to ſerve the Marcheſa and 


himſelf, by preventing the marriage of 
Vivaldi and Ellena, he had been laboriouſ- 
ly counteracting his own fortune. An alli- 
ance with the illuſtrious houſe of Vivaldi, 
was above his loftieſt hope of advance- 
ment, and this event he had himſelf nearly 
prevented by the very means which had 
been adopted, at the expence of every vir- 
tuous conſideration, to obtain an infe- 


rior promotion. Thus by a fingular re- 


tribution, his own crimes had recoiled 
upon himſelf. 
Schedoni perceived the many obſtacles, 


which lay between him and his newly 


awakened hopes, and that much was to be 


overcome before thoſe nuptials could be 


publicly folemnized, which he was now 
{till more anxious to promote, than he 
had lately been to prevent. The appro- 
bation of the Marcheſa was, at leaſt, deſir- 

able,

E 
able, for ſhe had much at her diſpoſal, and 
without it, though his daughter might be 
the wife of Vivaldi, he himſelf would be no 
otherwiſe benefited at preſent than by the 
honour of the connection. He had ſome 
particular reaſons for believing, that her 
conſent might be obtained, and, though 
there was hazard in delaying the nuptials till 
ſuch an experiment had been made, he re- 
folved to encounter it, rather than forbear 
to ſolicit her concurrence. But, if the 
Marcheſa ſhould prove inexorable, he de- 
termined to beſtow the hand of Ellena, 
without her knowledge, and in doing fo, 
he well knew that he incurred little dan- 
ger from her reſentment, ſince he had ſe- 
crets in his poſſeſſion, the conſciouſneſs of 
which muſt awe her into a ſpeedy neutrali- 
ty. The conſent of the Marcheſe, as he 
deſpaired of obtaining it, he did not mean 
to ſolicit, and the influence of the Mar- 
cheſa was ſuch, that Schedoni did not re- 


gard that as eſſential. 
| P 4 The

The firſt ſteps, however, to be taken, 
were thoſe that might releaſe Vivaldi from 
the Inquiſition, the tremendous priſon in- 
to which Schedoni himſelf, little foreſeeing 
that he ſhould fo ſoon with for his libera- 
tion, had cauſed him to be thrown. He 
had always underſtood, indeed, that it 
the Informer forbore to appear againſt the 
Accuſed in this Court, the latter would 
of courſe be liberated; and he alſo believ- 
ed, that Vivaldi's freedom could be ob- 
tained whenever he ſhould think proper to 
apply to a perſon at Naples, whom he 
knew to be connected with the Holy Office 
of Rome. How much the Confeſſor had 
ſuffered his wiſhes to deceive him, may ap- 
pear hereafter. His motives for having 
thus confined Vivaldi, were partly thoſe 
of ſelf-defence. He dreaded the diſcovery 
and the vengeance, which might follow the 
loſs of Ellena, ſhould Vivaldi be at liberty 
immediately to purſue his enquiries. But 
he believed that all trace of her muſt be 
loſt, 


„„ 
loſt, after a few weeks had elapſed, and 
that Vivaldi's ſufferings from confinement 
in the Inquiſition would have given inte- 
reſts to his mind, which muſt weaken the 
one he felt for Ellena. Yet, though in 
this inſtance ſelf-defence had been a prin- 
cipal motive with Schedoni, a defire of 
revenging the inſult he had received in 
the church of the Spirito Santo, and all 
the conſequent mortifications he expe- 
rienced, had been a ſecond ; and, ſuch was 
the blackneſs of his hatred, and the avarice 
of his revenge, that he had not conſidered 
the ſuffering, which theloſs of Ellenawould 
occaſion Vivaldi, as ſufficient retaliation. 
In adopting a mode of puniſhment ſo 
extraordinary as that of impriſonment in 
the Inquiſition, it appears, therefore, that 
Schedoni was influenced, partly by the dif- 
ficulty of otherwiſe confining Vivaldi, du- 
ring the period for which confinement was 
abſolutely neceſſary to the ſucceſs of his 
own ſchemes, and partly by a deſire of in-

flicting the tortures of terror. He had 
alſo been encouraged by his diſcovery of 
this opportunity for conferring new obli- 
gations on the Marcheſa. The very con- 
duct, that muſt have appeared to the firſt 
glance of an honeſt mind fatal to his in- 
tereſts, he thought might be rendered 
beneficial to them, and that his dexterity 
could ſo command the buſineſs, as that the 
Marcheſa ſhould eventually thank him 
as the deliverer of her ſon, inſtead of diſ- 
covering and execrating him as his Accu- 
ſer; a ſcheme favoured by the unjuſt and 
cruel rule enacted by the tribunal he ap- 
proached, which permitted anonymous In- 
formers. | 

To procure the arreſtation of Vivaldi, it 
had been only neceſſary to ſend a written 
accuſation, without a name, to the Holy 
Office, with a mention of the place where 
the accuſed perſon might be ſeized. But 
the fuffering in conſequence of ſuch infor- 
mation did not always proceed further than 


the 


. 

the guęſtiou; ſince, if the Informer failed to 
diſcover himſelf to the Inquiſitors, the pri- 
ſoner, after many examinations, was releaſed, 
unleſs he happened unwarily to criminate 
himſelf. Schedoni, as he did not intend 
to proſecute, believed, therefore, that 
Vivaldi would of courſe be diſcharged 
after a certain period, and ſuppoſing it 
alſo utterly impoſſible that he could 
ever diſcover his Accuſer, the Confeſſor 
determined to appear anxious and active 
in effecting his releaſe. This character of 
a deliverer, he knew he ſhould be the bet- 
ter enabled to ſupport by means of a per- 
ſon officially connected with the Holy Of- 
fice, who had already unconſciouſly aſſiſted 
his views. In the apartment of this man, 
Schedoni had accidentally ſeen a formula 
of arreſtation againſt a perſon ſuſpected of 
Hereſy, the view of which had not only 
ſmggeſted to him the plan he had ſince 
adopted, but had in ſome degree afliſted 


him to carry it into effect. He had ſeen 
7 6 the 


( 324 ) 

the ſcroll only for a ſhort time, but his 
obſervations were ſo minute, and his me- 
mory ſo clear, that he was able to copy 
it with at leaſt ſufficient exactneſs to im- 
poſe upon the Benedictine prieſt, who had, 
perhaps, ſeldom or never ſeen a real in- 
ſtrument of this kind. Schedoni had em- 
ployed this artifice for the purpoſe of im- 
mediately ſecuring Vivaldi, apprehending 
that, while the Inquiſitors were ſlowly de- 
liberating upon his arreſt, he might quit 
Celano, and elude diſcovery. If the de- 
ception ſucceeded, it would enable him 
alſo to ſeize Ellena, and to miſlead Vivaldi 
reſpecting her deſtination. The charge of 
having carried off a nun might appear to 
be corroborated by many circumſtances, 
and Schedoni would probably have made 
theſe the ſubject of real denunciation, had 
he not foreſeen the danger and the trouble 
in which it might implicate himſelf; and 
that, as the charge could not be ſubſtan- 
tiated, Ellena would finally eſcape. As 

| far 


( 325 ) 

far as his plan now went, it had been. ſuc- 
ceſsful ; ſome of the bravoes whom he 
hired to perſonate officials, had conveyed 
Vivaldi to the town, where the real officers 
of the Inquiſition were appointed to re- 
ceive him; while the others carried Ellena 
to the ſhore of the Adriatic. Schedoni 
had much applauded his own ingenuity, in 
thus contriving, by the matter of the 
forged accuſation, to throw an impene- 
trable veil over the fate of Ellena, and to 
ſecure himſelf from the ſuſpicions or ven- 
geance of Vivaldi, who, it appeared, would 
always believe that ſhe had died, or was 
{till confined in the unſearchable priſons 
of the Inquiſition. 

Thus he had betrayed himſelf in endea- 
youring to betray Vivaldi, whoſe releaſe, 
however, he yet ſuppoſed could be eafily 
obtained ; but how much his policy 
had, in this inſtance, outrun his ſagacity, 
now remained to be proved. | 

The ſubje&amp; of Schedoni's immediate 


9 perplexity 


( 326 ) 

perplexity was, the difficulty of convey- 
ing Ellena back to Naples ; ſince, not chuſ- 
ing to appear at preſent in the character 
of her father, he could not decorouſly 
accompany her thither himſelf, nor could 
he prudently entruſt her to the conduct 
of any perſon, whom he knew in this neigh- 
bourhood. It was, however, neceſſary to 
form a ſpeedy determination, for he could 
neither endure to paſs another day in a 
ſcene, which muſt continually impreſs him 
with the horrors of the preceding night, 
nor that Ellena ſhould remain in it; and 
the morning light already . upon 
his caſements. 

After ſome further deliberation, he re- 
ſolved to be himſelf her conductor, as far 
at leaſt as through the foreſts of the Garga- 
nus, and at the firſt town where conve- 
niencies could be procured, to throw aſide 
his Monk's habit, and, aſſuming the dreſs 
of a layman, accompany her in this diſ- 
guiſe towards Naples, till he ſnould either 

diſcover 


( 397 3 
diſcover ſome ſecure means of ſending her 
forward to that city, or a temporary aſy- 
lum for her in a convent on the way. 

His mind was ſcarcely more - tranquil, 
after having formed this determination, 
than before, and he did not attempt to 
repoſe himſelf even tor a moment. The 
circumſtances of the late diſcovery were 
almoſt perpetually recurring to his af- 
frighted conſcience, accompanied by a 
fear that Ellena might fuſpe&amp; the real 
purpoſe of his midnight viſit ; and he 
alternately formed and rejected plauſible 
falſehoods, that might aſſuage her curio- 
ſity, and delude her apprehenſion. 

The hour arrived, however, when it 
was neceflary to prepare for departure, 
and found him ſtill undecided as to the 
explanation he ſhould form. 

Having releaſed Spalatro from his 
chamber, and given him directions to 
procure horſes and a guide immediately 
from the neighbouring hamlet, he re- 

paired

paired to Ellena's room, to prepare her 
for this haſty removal. On approaching 
it, a remembrance of the purpoſe, with 
which he had laſt paſſed through theſe 
ſame paſſages and ſtair- caſe, appealed fo 
powerfully to his feelings, that he was 
unable to proceed, and he turned back 
to his own apartment to recover ſome 
command over himſelf. A few moments 
reſtored to him his uſual addreſs, though 
not his tranquillity, and he again ap- 
proached the chamber; it was now, how- 
ever, by way of the corridor. As he un- 
barred the door, his hand trembled ; but, 
when he entered the room, his counte- 
nanceand manner had reſumed their uſual 
ſolemnity, and his voice only would have 
betrayed, to an attentive obſerver, the agi- 
tation of his mind. 

Ellena was conſiderably affected on 
ſeeing him again, and he examined with 
a jealous eye the emotions he witneſſed. 
The ſmile with which ſhe met him was 

tender, 


( 329 ) 
tender, but he perceived it paſs away 
from her features, like the acrial colouring 
that illumines a mountain's brow ; and 
thegloom of doubt and apprehenſionagain 
overſpread them. As he advanced, he held 
torth his band forher's, when, ſuddenly per- 
ceiving the dagger he had left in the cham- 
ber, he involuntarily withdrew his prof- 
fered courteſy, and his countenance chang- 
ed. Ellena, whoſe eyes followed his to the 
object that attracted them, pointed to the 
inſtrument, took it up, and approaching 
him ſaid, This dagger I found laſt 
night in my chamber! O my father !''— 

That dagger !” faid Schedoni, with 
affected ſurprize. 

«Examine it, continued Ellena, while 
ſhe held it up. Do you know to whom 
it belongs? and who brought it hither?” 

« What is it you mean?” aſked Sche- 
doni, betrayed by his feelings. 

“ Do you know too for what pur- 

poſe 


E 
pole it was brought?“ ſaid Ellena mourn- 
fully. | : 

The Confeſſor made no reply, but irre- 
ſolutely attempted to ſeize the inſtrument. 

* O yes, I perceive you know too 
well,” continued Ellena, here, my 
father, while I flept”” 
Give me the dagger, 
Schedoni, in a frightful voice. 

« Yes, my father, I will give it as an 
offering of my gratitude,” replied Ellena ; 
but as ſhe raiſed her eyes, filled with 
tears, his look and fixed attitude terrified 
her, and ſhe added with a ſtill more perſua- 
five tenderneſs, Will you not accept the 
offering of your child, for having preſerved 
her from the poniard of an affaffin ?” 

Schedoni's looks became yet darker ; 
he took the dagger in filence, and threw 
it with violence to the fuicheſt end of 
the chamber, while his eyes remained 
fixed on her's. The force of the action 

alarmed 


interrupted 


(337 -) 

alarmed her; © Yes, it is in vain that 
you would conceal the truth,” ſhe added, 
weeping unreſtrainedly, © your goodneſs 
cannot avail ; I know the whole.” 

The laſt words arouſed Schedoni again 
from his trance, his features became con- 
vulſed, and his look furious. What 
do you know? he demanded in a ſub- 
dued voice, that ſeemed ready to burſt in 
thunder. 

* All that I owe you,” replied Ellena, 
that laſt night, while I flept upon this 
mattreſs, unſuſpicious of what was de- 
ſigned againſt me, an aſſaſſin entered the 
chamber with that inſtrument in his 
hand, and 9 7 
A ſtifled groan from Schedoni checked 
Ellena ; ſhe obſerved his rolling eyes, and 
trembled ; till, believing that his agitation 
was occaſioned by indignation againſt the 
aſſaſſin, the reſumed, © Why ſhould you 
think it neceſſary to conceal the danger 
which has threatened me, ſince it is to you 
that 


( 332 ) 
that I owe my deliverance from it? O! 
my father, do not deny me the pleaſure 
of ſhedding theſe tears of gratitude, do 
not refuſe the thanks, which are due to 
you! While I flept upon that couch, 
while a ruffian ſtole upon my ſlumber 
it was you, yes! can I ever forget that 
it was my father, who ſaved me from his 
pomard !” 
Schedoni's paſſions were changed, but 
they were not leſs violent ; he could 
ſcarcely controul them, while he ſaid in 
a tremulous tone“ It is enough, ſay 
no more;” and he raiſed Ellena, but 
turned away without embracing her. 
His ſtrong emotion, as he paced in 
filence the furtheſt end of the apartment, 
excited her ſurprize, but ſhe then attri- 
buted it to a remembrance of the peri- 
lous moment, from which he had reſcued 
her. 
Schedoni, meanwhile, to whom her 
thanks were daggers, was trying to ſub- 
due 


„ 
due the feelings of remorſe that tore his 
heart; and was ſo enveloped in a world 
of his own, as to be for ſome time un- 
conſcious of all around him. He con- 
tinued to ſtalk in gloomy ſilence along 
the chamber, till the voice of Ellena, 
entreating him rather to rejoice that he 
had been permitted to ſave her, than ſo 
deeply to conſider dangers which were paſt, 
again touched the chord that vibrated to 
his conſcience, and recalled him to a 
ſenſe of his ſituation. He then bade her 
prepare for immediate departure, and 
abruptly quitted the room. 

Vainly hoping that in flying from the 
ſcene of his meditated crime, he ſhould. 
leave with it the acuteneſs of remem- 
brance, and the agonizing ſtings of re- 
morſe, he was now more anxious than | 
ever to leave this place. Yet he ſhould

innocent looks, her affectionate thanks, | 8

( 334 ) 

endurable. Sometimes, thinking that her 
hatred, or what to him would be ſtill 
ſeverer, her contempt, muſt be more 
tolerable than this gratitude, he almoſt 
reſolved to undeceive her reſpecting his 
conduct, but as conſtantly and impa- 
tiently repelled the thought with horror, 
and finally determined to ſuffer her to 
account for his late extraordinary viſit in 
the way ſhe had choſen. 

Spalatro, at length, returned from the 
hamlet with horſes, but without having 
procured a guide to conduct the tra- 
vellers through a tract of the long- 
devolving foreſts of the Garganus, which 
it was neceſſary for them to paſs. No 
perſon had been willing to undertake fo 
arduous a taſk ; and Spalatro, who was 
well acquainted with all the labyrinths of 
the way, now offered his ſervices. 

Schedoni, though he could ſcarcely 
endure the preſence of this man, had no 
alternative but to accept him, ſince he 

kad

had diſmiſſed the guide who had con- 
ducted him hither. Of perſonal violence 
Schedoni had no apprehenſion, though he 
too well underſtood the villainy of his pro- 
poſed companion; for he conſidered that 
he himſelf ſhould be well armed, and he 
determined to aſcertain that Spalatro was 
without weapons; he knew alſo, that in 
caſe of a conteſt, his own ſuperior ſtature 
would eaſily enable him to overcome ſuch 
an antagoniſt. 

Every thing being now ready for de- 
parture, Ellena was ſummoned, and the 
Confeſſor led her to his own apartment, 
where a ſlight breakfaſt was prepared. 

Her ſpirits being revived by the ſpeed 
of this departure, ſhe would again have 
expreſſed her thanks, but he peremptorily 
interrupted her, and forbade any further 
mention of gratitude. 


On entering the court where the horſes 


were in waiting, and perceiving Spalatro, 
Ellena ſhrunk and put her arm within 
Schedoni's 


(380-7 
Schedoni's for protection.“ What recol- 
lections does the preſence of that man re- 
vive!” ſaid ſhe, © I can ſcarcely venture to 
believe myſelf ſafe, even with you, when he 
15 here.” 0 
Schedoni made no reply, till the remark 
was repeated, You have nothing to fear 
from him,“ muttered the Confeſſor, while 
he haſtened her forward, © and we have 
no time to loſe in vague apprehenſion.” 
„How!“ exclaimed Ellena, © 1s not 
he the aſſaſſin from whom you ſaved me! 
I cannot doubt, that you know him to be 
ſuch, though you would ſpare me the 
pain of believing ſo.” 
Well, well, be it ſo,” replied the Con- 
feſſor; © Spalatro, lead the horſes this way.” 
The party were ſoon mounted, when, 
quitting this eventful manſion, and the 
ſhore of the Adriatic, as Ellena hoped for 
ever, they entered upon the gloomy wil- 
derneſs of the Garganus. She often turn- 
ed her eyes back upon the houſe with 
emotions

emotions of inexpreſſible awe, aſtoniſh- 
ment, and thankfulneſs, and gazed while 
a glimpſe of its turretted walls could be 
. caught beyond the dark branches, which, 
cloſing over it, at length ſhut it from her 
view. The joy of this departure, however, 
was conſiderably abated by the preſence 
of Spalatro, and her fearful countenance 
enquired of Schedoni the meaning of his 


being ſuffered to accompany them. The 


Confeſſor was reluctant to ſpeak con- 
cerning a man, of whoſe very exiſtence he 
would willingly have ceaſed to think. El- 
lena guided her horſe ſtill cloſer to Sche- 
doni's, but, forbearing to urge the enquiry 
otherwiſe than by looks, ſhe received no 
reply,and endeavoured to quiet her appre- 
henſions, by conſidering that he would 
not have permitted this man to be 
their guide, unleſs he had believed he 
might be truſted. This conſideration, 
though it relieved her fears, encreaſed her 
perplexity reſpecting the late deſigns

of Spalatro, and her ſurpriſe that Sche- 
doni, if he had really underſtood them to 
be evil, ſhould endure his preſence. 
Every time ſhe ſtole a glance at the dark 
countenance of this man, rendered ſtill 
darker by the ſhade of the trees, ſhe 
thought“ aſſaſſin” was written in each 
line of it, and could ſcarcely doubt that 
he, and not the people who had conducted 
her to the manſion, had dropped the dag- 
ger in her chamber. Whenever ſhe looked 
round through the deep glades, and on the 
foreſt- mountains that on every fide cloſed 
the ſcene, and ſeemed to exclude all cheer- 
ful haunt of man, and then regarded her 
companions, her heart funk, notwith- 
ſtanding the reaſons ſhe had for beheving 
herſelf in the protection of a father. Nay, 
the very looks of Schedoni himſelf, more 
than once reminding her of his appearance 
on the ſea-ſhore, renewed the impreſſions 
of alarm and even of diſmay, which ſhe 
had there experienced. At ſuch moments 
it 


( 339 ) 
it was ſcarcely poſſible for her to conſider 
him as her parent, and, in ſpite of every 
late appearance, ſtrange and unaccounta- 
ble doubts began to gather on her mind. 
Schedoni, meanwhile, loſt in thought, 
broke not, by a ſingle word, the deep 
filence of the ſolitudes through which they 
paſſed. Spalatro was equally mute, and 
equally engaged by his reflections on the 
ſudden change in Schedoni's purpoſe, and 
by wonder as to the motive, which could 
have induced hnn to lead Ellena 1n fafety, 
from the very fpot whither ſhe was 
brought by his expreſs command to be 
deſtroyed. He, however, was not ſo 
wholly occupied, as to be unmindful of 
his ſituation, or unwatchful of an oppor- 
tunity of ſerving his own intereſts, and re- 
taliating upon Schedoni for the treatment 
he had received on the preceding night. 
Among the various ſubjects that diſ- 
tracted the Confeſſor, the difficulty of 
dliſpoſing of Ellena, without betraving at 
22 Naples 


i 


( 349 ) 

Naples that ſhe was his relative, was not 
the leaſt diſtreſſing. Whatever might be 
the reaſon which could juſtify ſuch feelings, 
his fears of a premature diſcovery of the 
circumſtance to the ſociety with whom 
he lived, were ſo ſtrong, as often to 
produce the moſt violent effect upon his 
countenance ; and it was, perhaps, when 
he was occupied by this ſubject, that its 
terrific expreſſion revived with Ellena the 
late ſcene upon the ſhore. His embar- 
raſſment was not leſs, as to the excuſe to 
be offered the Marcheſa, for having failed 

to fulfil his engagement, and reſpecting 
the means by which he might intereſt her in 
favour of Ellena, and even diſpoſe her to 
approve the marriage, before ſhe ſhould 
be informed of the family of this unfortu- 
nate young woman. Perceiving all the ne- 
ceſſity for aſcertaining the probabilities of 
ſuch conſent, before he ventured to make 
an avowal of her origin, he determined not 


to reveal himſelf till he ſhould be perfectly 
ſure 


( 341 ) 

ſure that the diſcovery would be accepta- 
ble to the Marcheſa. In the mean time, 
as it would be neceſſary to ſay ſomething 
of Ellena's birth, he meant to declare, that 
he had diſcovered it to be noble, and her 
family worthy, in every reſpect, of a con- 
nection with that of the Vivaldi. 

An interview with the Marcheſa, was 
almoſt equally wiſhed for and dreaded by 
the Confeſſor. He ſhuddered at the ex- 
pectation of meeting a woman, who had 
inſtigated him to the murder of his own 
child, which, though he had been happily 
prevented from committing it, was an act 
that would ſtill be wiſhed for by the 
Marcheſa. How could he endure her 
reproaches, when ſhe ſhould diſcover that 
he had failed to accompliſh her will! How 
conceal the indignation of a father, and 
diſſimulate all a father's various feelings, 
when, 1n reply to ſuch reproaches, he muſt 
form excuſes, and act humility, from 
which his whole ſoul would revolt ! Ne-

ver could his arts of diſſimulation have 
been ſo ſeverely tried, not even in the late 
ſcenes with Ellena, never have returned 
upon himſelf in puniſhment ſo ſevere, as 
in that which awaited him with the Mar- 
cheſa; and from its approach, the cool 
and politic Schedoni often ſhrunk in ſuch 
horror, that he almoſt determined to avoid 
it at any hazard, and ſecretly to unite Vi- 
valdi and Ellena, without even ſoliciting 

the conſent of the Marcheſa. | 
A deſire, however, of the immediate 
preferment, ſo neceſſary to his pride, con- 
ſtantly checked this ſcheme, and finally 
made him willing to ſubject every honeſt 
feeling, and ſubmit to any meanels, 
however vicious, rather than forego the 
favourite object of his erroneous ambition. 
Never, perhaps, was the paradoxical union 
of pride and abjectneſs, more ftrongly ex- 

hibited than on this occaſion. 

While thus the travellers filently proceed- 
ed, Ellena's thoughts often turned to Vi- 
valdi, 


( 


valdi, and ſhe conſidered, with trembling 


anxiety, the effect which the late diſcovery 
was likely to have upon their future lives. 
It appeared to her, that Schedoni muſt 
approve of a connection thus flattering to 
the pride of a father, though he would pro- 
bably refuſe his conſent to a private mar- 


rage. And, when ſhe further conſidered: 


the revolution, which a knowledge of her 
family might occaſion towards herlelt in the 
minds of the Vivaldi, her proſpects ſeemed 
to. brighten, and her cares began to diſſi- 
pate. Judging that Schedoni muſt be 


acquainted with the preſent ſituation of 


Vivaldi, ſhe was continually on the point 
of mentioning him, but was as conſtantly 
reftrained by timidity, though, had ſhe 


ſuſpected him to be an inhabitant” 


of the Inquiſition, her ſcruples would 
have vaniſhed before an iro ble intereſt,

cluded, as has before appeared, that he 
now ſuffered a temporary impriſonment 
by order of his mother, at one of the 
family villas. When, however, Schedoni, 
awaking from his reverie, abruptly men- 
tioned Vivaldi, her ſpirits fluttered with 
impatience to learn his exact ſituation, 
and ſhe enquired reſpecting it. 

«I am no ſtranger to your attach- 
ment,” ſaid Schedoni, evading the queſ- 
tion, but I wiſh to be informed of ſome 
circumſtances relative to its commence- 
ment.” 

Ellena, confuſed, and not knowing 
what to reply, was for a moment filent, 
and then repeated her enquiry. 

« Where did you firſt meet?“ ſaid the 
Confeſſor, {till diſregarding her queſtion, 
Ellena related, that ſhe had firſt ſeen 
Vivaldi, when attending her aunt from 
the church of San Lorenzo. For the 
preſent ſhe was ſpared the embarraſlment 
of further explanation by Spalatro, who, 

riding 


( 345 ) 

riding up to Schedoni, informed him they 
were approaching the town of Zanti. On 
looking forward, Ellena perceived houſes 
peeping from among the foreſt-trees, at a 
ſhort diſtance, and preſently heard the 
cheerful bark of a dog, that ſure herald 

and faithful ſervant of man 
Soon after the travellers entered Zanti, 
a {mall town ſurrounded by the foreſt, 
where, however, the poverty of the inha- 
bitants ſeemed to forbid a longer ſtay 
than was abſolutely neceſſary for repoſe, 
and a flight refreſhment. Spalatro led 
the way to a cabin, in which the few per- 
{ons that journied this road were uſually 
entertained. The appearance of the peo- 
ple, who owned it, was as wild as their 
country, and the interior of the dwelling 
was ſo dirty and comfortleſs, that Sche- 
doni, preferring to take his repaſt in the 
open air, a table was ſpread under the 
luxuriant ſhade of the foreſt-trees, at a 
little diſtance. Here, when the hoſt 
Q 5 had 


( 346 ) 

had. withdrawn, and Spalatro had been 
diſpatched to examine the poſt-horſes, and. 
to procure a lay-habit for the Confeſſor, 
the latter, once more alone with Ellena, 
began to experience again ſomewhat of 
the embaraſſments of conſcience; and 
Ellena, whenever her eyes glanced upon. 
him, ſuffered a ſolemnity of fear that roſe 
almoſt to terror. He, at length, termi-- 
nated this emphatic filence, by renewing. 
his mention of Vivaldi, and his command 
that Ellena ſhould relate the hiſtory of 
their affection. Not daring to refuſe, ſhe 
obeyed, but with as much brevity as poſ- 
ſible, and Schedoni did not interrupt her 
by a ſingle obſervation. However eligible 
their nuptials now appeared to him, he for- 
bore to give any hint of approbation, till, 
he ſhould have extricated the object of her, 
regards from his perilous ſituation. But, 
with Ellena, this very. ſilence. implied the. 
opinion it was meant to. conceal, and, 
encouraged by the hope it imparted, ſhe, 

6 ventured, 


( 347 ) 


ventured once more to aſk, by whoſe order 


Vivaldi had been arreſted; whither he had 


been conveyed, and the circumſtances of 


his preſent ſituation. 

Too politic to intruſt her with a know- 
edge of his actual condition, the Confeſſoi 
ſpared her the anguiſh of learning that Vi- 
valdi was a priſoner in the Inquiſition. He 
affected ignorance of the late tranſaction at 
Celano; but ventured to believe, that bottr 
Vivaldi and herſelf had been arreſted by 
order of the Marcheſa, who, he conjec- 
tured, had thrown him into temporary 
confinement, a mieaſure which ſhe, no 


doubt, had meant to enforce allo towards 


Ellena.. 

And you, my father,“ oblerved Elle- 
na, what brought you to my priſon 
you who was not informed with the Mar- 
cheſa's deſigns? What accident conducted 


you to that remote ſolitude, juſt at the 
moment when you could fave your: 


child!“ 
Q 6 *© Informed 


( 348 ) 

* Informed of the Marcheſa's deſigns !”” 
ſaid Schedoni, with embarraſſment and diſ- 
pleaſure: Have you ever imagined that 
I could be acceſſary - that I could conſent 
to aſſiſt, I mean could conſent to be a con- 
fidant of ſuch atrocious” Schedoni, 
bewildered, confounded, and half betray- 
ed, reſtrained himſelf. 

* Yet you have ſaid, the Marcheſa meant 
only to confine me?” obſerved Ellena ; 
* was that deſign ſo atrocious ? Alas, my 
father ! I know too well that her plan was 
more atrocious, and fince you alſo had too 
much reaſon to know this, why do you 
ſay that impriſonment only was intended 
for me? But your ſolicitude for my tran- 
quillity leads you to 

What means,” interrupted the ſuſpi- 
cious Schedoni, © can I particularly have 
of underſtanding the Marcheſa's ſchemes ? 
I repeat, that I am not her confidant ; how 
then is it to be ſuppoſed I ſhould know _ 
that they extended further than to impri- 
ſonment ?” 


« Did 


( 349 ) 

*« Did you not ſave me from the arm of 
the aflaſſin !” ſaid Ellena tenderly ; © did 
not you wrench the very dagger from his 
graſp !'? 

I had forgotten, I had forgotten,” ſaid 
the Confeſſor, yet more embarraſſed. 

Ves, good minds are ever thus apt to 
forget the benefits they confer,” replied 
Ellena. „But you ſhall find, my father, 
that a grateful heart is more watchful to 
remember them; it is the indelible regi- 
ſter of every act that is diſmiſſed from the 
memory of the benefactor.” 

Mention no more of benefits,” ſaid 
Schedoni, impatiently ; © let filence on this 
ſubject Wen indicate your wiſh to 
oblige me. 

He roſe, and joined the hoſt, who was 
at the door of his cabin. Schedoni with- 
ed to diſmiſs Spalatro as ſoon as poſſible, 
and he enquired for a guide to conduct 
him through that part of the foreſt, which 
remained to be traverſed, In this poor 

town, 


(" $50- ) 
town, a perſon willing to undertake that 
office was eaſily to be found, but the hoſt 
went inqueſt of a neighbour whom he had 
recommended. 

Meanwhile Spalatro returned, without 
having ſucceeded in his commiſſion. Not 
any lay- habit could be procured,.upon ſo 
| ſhort æ notice, that ſuited Schedoni. He 
was obliged, therefore, to continue his 
journey to the next town at leaſt, in his 
own dreſs, but the neceflity was not very 
ſerious to him, ſince it was improbable that 
he ſhould be known in this obſcure re- 
gion. 

Preſently the hoſt appeared with his 
neighbour, when Schedoni, having receiv- 
ed ſatisfactory anſwers to his queſtions, 
engaged him for the remainder of the fo- 
reſt- road, and diſmiſſed Spalatro. The 
ruffian departed with ſullen reluctance and 
evident ill-will, circumſtances which the 
Confeſſor ſcarcely noticed, while occupied 
by the ſatisfaction of. eſcaping from tho 

preſence 


(364-3 


preſence of the atrocious partner of his: 


conſcience. But Ellena, as he paſſed her, 


obſerved the malignant diſappointment of 


his look, and it ſerved only to heighten. 
the thankfulneſs his abſence occaſioned 


her. 


It was afternoon before the travellers: 


proceeded. Schedoni had calculated that 
they could eaſily reach the town, at which 


he deſigned to paſs the night, before the 
cloſe of evening, and he had been in no 


haſte to ſet forward during the heat of the 
day. Their track now lay through a country 
Je ſavage, though ſcarcely leſs wild, than, 
that they had paſſed in the morning. It 
emerged from the interior towards the 
border of the foreſt ; they were no lon- 


ger encloſed by impending mountains; 


the withdrawing. ſhades were. no longer; 
impenetrable to the eye, but now and, 
then opened to gleams of. ſunſhine- land- 
ſcape, and blue diſtances; and in the im- 
mediate ſcene, many a green glade ſpread.

( 352 ) 

its boſom to the ſun. The grandeur of 
the trees, however, did not decline; the 
plane, the oak, and the cheſtnut {till 
threw a pomp of foliage round theſe ſmil- 
ing ſpots, and ſeemed to conſecrate the 
mountain-ſ{treams, that deſcended beneath 
their ſolemn ſhade. 

To the haraffed ſpirits of Ellena the 
changing ſcenery was refreſhing, and ſhe 
frequently yielded her cares to the in- 
fluence of majeſtic nature. Over the 
gloom of Schedoni, no ſcenery had, at any 
moment, power; the ſhape and paint of 
external imagery gave neither impreſſion 
or colour to his fancy. He contemned the 
ſweet illuſions, to which other ſpirits are 
hable, and which often confer a delight 
more exquiſite, and not leſs innocent, 
than any which deliberative reaſon can - 
beſtow. | 

The ſame thoughtful filence, that had 
wrapt him at the beginning of the jour- 
ney, he ſtill preſerved, except when occa- 

4 ſionally 


(- $83: -/ 
ſionally he aſked aqueſtion ofthe guide con- 


cerning the way, and received anſwers too 


loquacious for his humour. This loqua- 
city, however, was not eaſily repreſſed, and 
the peaſant had already begun to relate 
ſome terrible ſtories of murder committed 
in theſe foreſts, upon people who had been 
hardy enough to venture into them with- 
out a guide, before the again abſtracted 
Schedoni even noticed that he ſpoke. 
Though Ellena did not give much credit 
to theſe narratives, they had ſome effect 
upon her fears, when ſoon after ſhe entered 
the deep ſhades of a part of the foreſt, that 
lay along a narrow defile, whence every 
glimpſe of cheerful landicape was again ex- 
cluded by precipices, which towered on ei- 
ther fide. The ſtillneſs was not leſs effectual 
than the gloom, for no ſounds were heard, 
except ſuch as ſeemed to characterize ſoli- 
tude, and impreſs its awful power more 
deeply on the heart the hollow daſh- 


ingof torrents deſcending diſtantly, and the

deep ſighings of the wind, as it paſſed 
among trees which threw their broad arms 
over the cliffs, and crowned the higheſt 
ſummits. Onward, through the narrow- 
ing windings of the defile, no living object 
appeared; but, as Ellena looked fearfully 
back, ſhe thought ſhe diſtinguiſhed a hu- 
man figure advancing beneath the duſky 
umbrage that cloſed the view. She com- 
municated her ſuſpicion to Schedoni, 
though not her fears, and they ſtopped 
for a moment, to obſerve further. The 
object advanced ſlowly, and they perceived 
the ſtature of a man, who, having conti- 
nued to approach, ſuddenly pauſed, and 
then glided away behind the foliage that 
croſſed the perſpective, but not before 
Ellena fancied ſhe diſcriminated the figure 
of Spalatro. None but a purpoſe the 
moſt deſperate, ſhe believed, could have 
urged him to follow into this paſs, inſtead 
of returning, as he had pretended, to his 
tome. Yet it appeared improbable, that 

he 


(35s .) 

he alone ſhould be willing to attack two 
armed perſons, for both Schedoni and the 
guide had weapons of defence. This con- 
{ideration afforded her only a momentary 
reſpite from apprehenſion, ſince it was poſ- 
ſible that he might not be alone, though 
only one perſon had yet been ſeen among 
the ſhrouding branches of the woods, 
Did you not think he reſembled Spala- 
tro?“ {aid Ellena to the Confeflor, © was 
he not of the ſame ſtature and air? You are 
well armed, or I ſhould fear for you as 
well as for myſelf.” 

&amp; did not obſerve a reſemblance,” 
replied Schedoni, throwing a glance back, 
e but whoever he is, you have nothing 
to apprehend from him, for he has diſ- 
appeared.” 

« Yes, Signor, ſo much the wore? 
obſerved the guide, © ſo much the 
worte, if he means us any harm, for he 
can ſteal along the rocks behind theſe 
thickets, and ſtrike out upon us before 

we 


( 356 ) 

we are aware of him. Or, if he knows 
the path that runs among thoſe old oaks 
yonder, on the left, where the ground 
riſes, he has us ſure at the turning of 
the next cliff.“ 

Speak lower,” ſaid Schedoni, un- 
leſs you mean that he ſhould benefit by 
your inſtructions,” 

Though the Confeſſor ſaid this without 
any ſuſpicion of evil intention from the 
guide, the man immediately began to 
juſtify himſelf, and added, I'll give him 
a hint of what he may expect, however, 
if he attacks us.“ As he ſpoke, he fired 
his trombone in the air, when every rock 
reverberated the ſound, and the faint 
and fainter thunder retired in murmurs 
through all the windings of the defile. 
The eagerneſs, with which the guide had 
juſtified himſelf, produced an effect upon 
Schedoni contrary to what he deſigned; 
and the Confeſſor, as he watched him 
ſuſpiciouſly, obſerved, that after he had 
| fired, 


1 
fired, he did not load his piece again. 
&lt;* Since you have given the enemy ſuffi- 
cient intimation where to find us,“ ſaid 
Schedoni, you will do well to prepare 
for his reception; load again, friend. I, 
too, have arms, and they are ready.“ 
While the man ſullenly obeyed, El- 
lena, again alarmed, looked back in ſearch 
of the ſtranger, but not any perſon ap- 
peared beneath the gloom, and no foot- 
ſtep broke upon the ſtillneſs. When, 
however, ſhe ſuddenly heard a ruſtling 
noiſe, ſhe looked to the bordering thick- 
ets, almoſt expecting to ſee Spalatro break 
from among them, before ſhe perceived 
that it was only the ſounding pinions of 
birds, which, ſtartled by the report of 
the trombone from their high neſts in 
the cliffs, winged their way from danger. 
The ſuſpicions of the Confeſſor had, 
probably, been ſlight, for they were tran- 
fient ; and when Ellena next addrefled 
him, he had again retired within himſelf. 
He was ruminating upon an excuſe to be 
offered 


( $58 
offered the Marcheſa, which might be 
ſufficient both to aſſuage her diſappoint- 
ment and baffle her curioſity, and he 
could not, at prefent, fabricate one that 

- might ſoothe her reſentment, without 
riſk of betraying his ſecret. 

Twilight had added its gloom to that 
of the rocks, before the travellers diſtin- 
guiſhed the town at which they meant to 
paſs the night. It terminated the defile, 
and its grey houſes could ſcarcely be diſ- 
cerned from the precipice upon which 
they hung, or from the trees that em- 
boſomed them. A rapid ſtream rolled 
below, and over it a bridge conducted 
the wanderers to the little inn at which 
they were to take up their abode. Here, 
quietly lodged, Ellena diſmiſſed all preſent 
apprehenſion of Spalatro, but ſhe {till 
believed ſhe had ſeen him, and her ſuſpi- 
cions, as to the motive of his extraordinary 
Journey, were not appealed. 

As this was a town of ampler accom- 
modationthan the one they had left, Sche- 


dom 


( 399 | 

doni eafily procured a lay-habit, that 
would diſguiſe him for the remainder of 
the journey, and Ellena was permitted to 
lay aſide the nun's veil, for one of a more 
general faſhion ; but, in thus diſmiſſing it, _ 
ſhe did not forget that it had been the veil 
of Olivia, and ſhe preſerved it as a ſacred 
relique of her favourite recluſe. 

The diſtance between this town and 
Naples, was {till that of ſeveral days jour- 
ney, according to the uſual mode of tra- 
velling; but the moſt dangerous part of 
the way was now overcome, the road 
having emerged from the foreſts ; and 
when Schedoni, on the following morn- 
ing, was departing, he would have diſ- 
charged the guide, had not the- hoſt 
aſſured him, he would find one {till neceſ- 
ſary in the open, but wild, country through 
which he muſt paſs. Schedoni's diſtruſt 
of this guide had never been very ſerious, 
and, as the reſult of the preceding even- 
ing proved favourable, he had reftored 
him lo entirely to his confidence, as will- 
ingly 


( 360 ) 
ingly to engage him for the preſent day. 
In this confidence, however, Ellena did not 
perfectly coincide; ſhe had obſerved the 
man while he loaded the trombone, on 
Schedoni's order, and his evident reluc- 
tance, had almoſt perſuaded her, that he 
was in league with ſome perſon who de- 
ſigned to attack them ; a conjecture, per- 
haps, the moſt readily admitted while her 
mind was ſuffering from the impreſſion of 
having ſeen Spalatro. She now ventured 
to hint her diſtruſt to the Confeſſor, who 
paid little attention to it, and reminded 
her, that ſufficient proof of the man's 
honeſty had appeared, in their having been 
permitted to paſs in ſafety, a defile ſo con- 
venient for the purpoſe of rapine as that 
of yeſterday. To a reply apparently ſo 
reaſonable, Ellena could oppoſe nothing, 
had ſhe even dared to preſs the topic; 
and ſhe re- commenced the journey with 
gayer hopes. He, wrapt in clouds of my ſtery and ſilence, 


Eroods o'er his paſſions, bodies them in deeds,

ON this day, Schedoni was more com- 
municative than on the preceding one. 
While they rode apart from the guide, 
he converſed with Ellena on various 
topics relative to herſelf, but without 
once alluding to Vivaldi, and even. con- 
deſcended to mention his deſign of diſ- 
poſing of her in a convent at ſome diſ-

tance from Naples, till it ſhould be con- 


vemient for him to acknowledge her for 


his daughter. But the difficulty of find- 
ing a ſuitable ſituation embarraſſed him, 
and he was diſconcerted by the aukward- 
neſs of introducing her himſelf to ſtran- 
gers, whoſe curiofity would be heightened 
by a ſenſe of their intereſt. 

Theſe conſiderations induced him the 
more eaſily to attend to the dittrets of 
Ellena, on her learning that ſhe was 
again to be placed at a diſtance from her 
home, and among ſtrangers; and the 
more willingly to liſten to the account 
ſhe gave of the convent della Picta, and 
to her requeſt of returning thither. But 
in whatever degree he might be inclined 
to approve, he liſtened without content- 
ing, and Ellena had only the conſolation 
of perceiving that he was not abſolutely 
determined to adopt his firſt plan. 

Her thoughts were too deeply cn- 
gaged upon her future proſpects to per- 
mit

mit leiſure for preſent fears, or probably 
ſhe would have ſuffered ſome return of 
thoſe of yeſterday, in traverſing the lonely

plains and rude vallies, through which 
the road lay. Schedoni was thankful te 
the landlord, who had advited him to 
keep the guide, the road being frequentiy 
obſcured amongit the wild heaths that 
{ſtretched around, and the eye often ſweep—

perceiving a village, or any human dwell-

had not met one traveller, and they con- 
tinued to proceed bencuili the heat ot᷑ 
noon, becauſe Schedoni had been unable 
to diſcover even a cottage, in which 
ſhelter and repoſe might be obtained. 

It was late in the day when the guide 
pointed out the grey walls of an edifice, 
which crowned the acclivity they were 
approaching. But this was ſo ſhrouded 
among woods, that no feature of it could be 
diſtinctly ſecn, and it did but ſlightly awa-

ken their hopes of diſcovering a convent, 
which might receive them with hoſpitality. 

The high banks overſhadowed with 
thickets, between which the road aſ- 
cended, ſoon excluded even a glimpſe 
of the walls; but, as the travellers turned 
the next projection, they perceived a per- 
on on the ſummit of the road, croſſing 


as if towards ſome place of reſidencc, 


and concluded that the edifice they had 
ſeen was behind the trees, among which. 
he had diſappeared. 

A few moments broaght them to the 
ſpot, where, retired at a thort diflance 
among the woods that browed the hill, 
they obſerved the extenſive remains of 
what feemed to have been a villa, and 
which, from the air of detolation it exhi- 
bited, Schedoni would have judged to be 
wholly deſerted, had he not already 
ſeen a perſon enter. Wearied and ex- 
hauſted, he determined to aſcertain whe- 


ther any refreſhment could be procured 
from 


E 


from the inhabitants within, and the party 
alighted before the portal of a deep and 
broad avenue of arched ſtone, which 
ſeemed to have been the grand approach 
to the villa, Over this majeſtic portal roſe 
the light holes and tall heads of aloes ; 
while the Indian-fig threw its broad leaves 
in many a luxuriant cluſter among the ca- 
pitals and rich ornaments below. The en- 
trance was obſtructed by fragments of co- 
lumns, and by the underwood that had taken 
root amongſt them. "The travellers, how- 
ever, eaſily overcame theſe interruptions : 
but, as the avenue was of confiderable ex- 
tent, and as its only ligbt proceeded from 
the portal, except what a few narrov” 
loops in the walls admitted, they ſoon 
found themſelves involved in an obfſcu- 
rity that rendered the way difficult, and 
Schedoni endeavoured to make himſelf 
heard by the perſon he had ſeen. The 
effort was unſucceſsful, but, as they pro- 
ceeded, a bend in the paſſage ſhewed a

diſtant glimmering of light, which ſerved 
to guide them to the oppoſite entrance, 
where an arch opened immediately into a 
court of the villa. Schedoni pauſed here 
in diſappointment, for every object ſeemed 
to bear evidence of abandonment and de- 
ſolation; and he looked, almoſt hopeleſsly, 
round the light colonnade which ran along 
three ſides of the court, and to the palme- 
tos that waved over the fourth, in ſearch of 
the perſon, who had been ſeen from the 
road. No human figure ſtole upon the

Schedoni, mean while, ſtood in the court, 
like the evil ſpirit of the place, examining 
its deſolation, and endeavouring to aſ- 
certain whether any perſon lurked in the 
interior of the building. Several doorways 
in the colonnade appeared to lead to cham- 
bers of the villa, and, after a ſhort hefita- 
tion, Schedoni, having determined to 
purſue his inquiry, entered one of them, 
and paſſed through a marble hall to a 
fuite of rooms, whoſe condition told how 
long it was tince they had been inha- 
bited. The roots had entirely vaniſhed, 
and even portions of the walls had fallen, 
and lay in maſſes amongſt the woods 
without, 

Perceiving that it was as uſcleſs as 
difficult to proceed, the confeſlor re- 
turned to the court, where the ſhade of 
the palmetos, at leaſt, offered an hoſ- 
pitable ſhelter to the wearied travellers. 
They repoſed themſelves beneath the tow- 
ering branches, on ſome fragments of a

to the extenſive landſcape, now mellowed 
by the evening beams, and partook of the 
remains of a repaſt, which had been de- 
poſited in the wallet of the guide.

at all, had ſupped, and been aſleep ſome 
time. Now it happened, that the Barone's 
chamber was in a tower of the old build- 
ing, at which people often wondered, 
becauſe, ſaid they, why ſhould he chuſe 
to ſleep in the old part when there are ſo 
many fine rooms in the new villa ? but ſo 
it was.” 

6 Come, diſpatch your meal,” ſaid 
Schedoni, awaking from his deep muſing, 
the ſun is ſetting, and we have yet far 
to go.“ 

« I will finiſn the meal and the ſtory 
together, Signor, with your leave,“ replied 
the guide. Schedoni did not notice what 
he ſaid, and, as the man was not for- 
bidden, he proceeded with his relation. 

Now it happencd, that the Barone's 


chamber was in that old tower, —if you 


will look this way, Signora, you _y lee - 

what 1s left of it.” 
Ellena turned her attention to where 
the guide pointed, and perceived the ſhat- 
tered 


(-14- 


tered remains of a tower riſing beyond 
the arch, through which ſhe had entered 
the court. 

© You ſee that corner of a window calc, 
left in the higheſt part of the wall, Sig- 
nora, continued the guide, © juſt by that 
fig-tree, which grows out of the ſtone.” 

« IT obſerve,” ſaid Ellena. 

&amp; Well, that was one of the windows 
of the very chamber, Signora, and you 
ſee ſcarcely any thing elle is left of it. 
Yes, there 1s the door-caſe, too, but the 
door itfelf is gone; that little ſtaircaſe, 
which you ſce beyond it, led up to another 
ſtory, which nobody now would gueſs had 
ever been; for roof, and flooring, and 
all are fallen. I wonder how that little 
ſtaircaſe in the corner happened to hold ſo 
faſt !” 

Have you almoſt done?“ inquired 
Schedoni, who had not apparently at- 
tended to any thing the man ſaid, and 
now alluded to the refreſhment he was 
taking.

( 


« Yes, Signor, I have not a great deal 
more to tell, or to eat either, for that 
matter, replied the guide; * but you 


ſhall hear. Well, yonder was the very 


chamber, Signora; at that door-caſe, 


Which is fill in the wall, the Barone 


came in; ah! he little thought, I warrant, 
that he ſhould never more go out at it! 
How long he had been in the room I do 
not know, nor whether he was aſleep, or 


awake, for there is nobody that can tell ; 


but when the great ſhock came, it ſplit 
the old tower at once, before any other 
part of the buildings. You fee that heap 
of ruins, yonder, on the ground, Signora, 


there he the remains of the chamber; 


the Barone, they ſay, was buried under 

them !” | 
Ellena ſhuddered while ſhe gazed upon 
this deſtructive maſs. A groan from 
Schedoni ſtartled her, and ſhe turned 
towards him, but, as he appeared ſhrouded 
in meditation, ſhe again directed her 
| attention 


( 16 ) 


attention to this awful memorial. As her 
eye paſſed upon the neighbouring arch, 
ſhe was ſtruck with the grandeur of its 
proportions, and with its ſingular appear- 
ance, now that the evening rays glanced 
upon the overhanging ſhrubs, and darted 
a line of partial light athwart the avenue 
beyond. But what was her emotion, 
when ſhe perceived a perſon gliding away 
in the perſpective of the avenue, and, as 
he croſſed where the gleam fell, diſtin- 
guiſhed the figure and countenance nf 
Spalatro ! She had ſcarcely power faintly 
to exclaim, © Steps go there!“ before he 
had diſappeared; and, when Schedoni 
looked round, the vacuity and ſilence of 
folitude every where preyailed, 

Ellena now did not ſcruple poſitively to 
affirm that the had ſeen Spalatro, and 
Schedoni, fully ſenſible that, if her imagi- 
nation had not deluded her, the purpoſe 
of his thus tracing their route muſt be 
deſperate, immediately roſe, and, followed 


by 


3 


by the peaſant, paſſed into the avenue to 
aſcertain the truth, leaving Ellena alone 
in the court. He had ſcarcely diſap- 
peared before the danger of his adven- 
turing into that obſcure paſſage, where an 
aſſaſſin might ſtrike unſeen, forcibly oc- 


\ curred to Ellena, and ſhe loudly conjured 


him to return. She liſtened for his voices 
but heard only his retreating ſteps ; when, 
too anxious to remain where ſhe was, ſhe 
haſtened to the entrance of the avenue, 
But all was now huſhed ; neither voice, 
nor ſteps were diſtinguiſhed. Awed by 
tne gloom of the place, ſhe feared to ven- 
ture further, yet almoſt equally dreaded 
to remain alone in any part of the ruin, 
while a man ſo deſperate as Spalatro wa 
hovering about it. 

As the yet liſtened at the entrance of 


the avenue, a faint cry, which ſeemed 


to iſſue from the interior of the villa, 


reached her. The firſt dreadful ſurmiſe 


that ſtruck Ellena was, that they were 


mur- 


( 18 ) 


murdering her father, who had proba- 
bly been decoyed, by another paſlage, 
back into ſome chamber of the ruin; 
when, inſtantly forgetting every fear 
for herſelf, ſhe haſtened towards the 
{pot whence ſhe judged the ſound to 
have iſſued. She entered the hall, which 
Schedoni had noticed, and paſſed on 
through a ſuite of apartments beyond. 
Every thing here, however, was filent, 
and the place apparently deſerted. The 
ſuite terminated in a paſlage, that ſeemed 
to lead to a diſtant part of the villa, and 
Ellena, after a momentary heſitation, 
determined to follow it. 

She made her way with difficulty be- 
tween the half demolithed walls, and was 
obliged to attend ſo much to her ſteps, 
that ſhe ſcarcely noticed whither ſhe was 
going, till, the deepening ſhade of the 
place recalling her attention, ſhe per- 
ceived herſelf among the ruins of the 
tower, whoſe hiſtory had been related 

by 


6 


by the guide; and, on looking up, 
obſerved ſhe was at the foot of the 
ſtaircaſe, which ſtill wound up the wall 


mat had led to the chamber of the Ba- 
'Tone. 
* At a moment leſs anxious, the cir- 


cumſtance would have aftecled her; 
but now, ſhe could only repeat her calls 


upon the name of Schedoni, and liſten 
for ſome ſignal that he was near. 


Still 


receiving no anſwer, nor hearing any 


further ſound of diſtreſs, ſhe began to 
hope that her fears had deceived her, 
and having aſcertained that the paſſage 
| terminated here, ſhe quitted the ſpot. 


On regaining the firſt chamber, El- 


lena reſted for a moment to recover 
breath; and, while ſhe leaned upon 


What had once been a window, opening 


of fire arms.

The ſound ſwelled, and 


— ſeemed to revolve along the avenue 
through which Schedoni had diſappeared,

6 160) 


—Suppoſing that the combatants were 
engaged at the furtheſt entrance, Ellena 
was preparing to go thither, when a 
ſudden ſtep moved near her, and, on 


turning, ſhe diſcovered, with a degree 


of horror that almoſt deprived her of 
recollection, Spalatro himſelf ſtcaling 
along the very chamber in which ſhe 
was. 
That part of the room which ſhe 
ſtood in, fell into a kind of receſs; and 
whether it was this circumſtance that 
prevenied him from immediately per- 
ceiving her, or that, his chief purpoſe 
being directed againſt another object, 
he did not chuſe to pauſe here, he paſſed 
on with ſkulking ſteps; and, before 
Ellena had determined whither to go, 
ſhe obſerved him croſs the court beſore 
her, and enter the avenue. As he had 
paſſed, he looked up at the window : 
and it was certain he then ſaw her, for 
he inſtantly faltered, but in the next 
mo- 


C2 7 


moment proceeded ſwiftly, and diſap- 
peared in the gloom. | 

It ſeemed that he had not yet en- 
countered Schedoni, but it alſo occurred 
to Ellena, that he was gone into the 
avenue for the purpoſe of waiting to 


aſlaflinate him in the darkneſs. While 
ſhe was meditating ſome means of 
giving the Confeſſor a timely alarm of 
his danger, ſhe once more diſtinguiſhed 
his voice. It approached from the 
avenue, and Ellena immediately calling 
aloud that Spalatro was there, entreated 
him to be on his guard. In the next in- 
ſtant a piſtol was fired there. 

Among the voices that ſucceeded the 


e report, Ellena thought ſhe diſtinguiſhed 


groans. Schedoni's voice was in the 
next moment heard again, but it ſeemed 


_ Faint and low. The courage which ſhe 
had before exerted was now exhauſted ; 


ſhe remained fixed to the ſpot, unable

almoſt ſinking beneath the expectation 


of it. 


All was now huſhed ; ſhe liſtened for 
Schedoni's voice, and even for a foot- 
ſtep—in vain. To endure this ſtate of 
uncertainty much longer was ſcarcely 


poſſible, and Ellena was endeavouring 
to collect fortitude to meet a knowledge 


of the worſt, when ſuddenly a feeble 
groaning was again heard. It ſeemed 
near, and to be approaching ſtill nearer. 
At that moment, Ellena, on looking to- 
wards the avenue, perceived a figure co- 
vered with blood, paſs into the court. A 
film, which drew over her eyes, prevented 
her noticing further. She tottered a few 
paces back, and caught at the fragment 
of a pillar, by which ſhe ſupported 
herſelf. The weakneſs was, however, 
tranſient ; immediate aſſiſtance appeared 
neceſſary to the wounded perſon, and 
pity ſoon predominating over horror, *

When, 
round in ſearch of Schedoni, he was no

he was wounded, vengeance might give 
him ſtrength to ſtrike his ſtiletto at the 
heart of whomſoever approached him, 
while the duſkineſs of the place would fa-

She was yet at the entrance of the 
paſſage, fearful to enter, and reludtant 
to leave it, liſtening for a ſound, and 
ſtill hearing at intervals, ſwelling though 
feeble groans; when quick ſteps were 
ſuddenly heard advancing up the grand 
avenue, and preſently her own name 
was repeated loudly in the voice of 
Schedoni. His manner was hurried as 
he advanced to meet her, and he threw an 
eager glance round the court.” © We 
mult be gone,” ſaid he, in a low tone,

„Where? — Which way did he go!“

Ellena, inſtantly comprehending his 


motive for the queſtion, would not ac- 


knowledge that ſhe knew whither Spa- 
latro had withdrawn; and, reminding 


him of the danger of their fituation, ſhe 


entreated that they might quit the villa 
immediately.

doni.

aſked Schedoni, with anger. © You

ſaid Ellena. © Do not, by remaining 
here, leave me a poſiibility of grieving for 
you. What anguiſh it would occaſion 
you, to ſee me bleed; judge, then, what 
muſt be mine, if you are wounded by the 
dagger of an ailaſlin !” 
Schedoni ſtifled the groan which ſwelled 
ſrom his heart, and abruptly turned away. 
% You trifle with me,” he ſaid, in the 
next moment: © you do not know that 
the villain is wounded. I fired at him, it 
is true, at the inſtant I ſaw him enter 
the avenue, but he has eſcaped me. 
What reaſon have you for your ſuppo—

Ellena was going to point to the track 
of blood on the ground, at a little diſ- 
tance, but reſtrained herſelf ; conſidering 
that

latro, and again ſhe entreated they might

doni, impatiently. 

„An aſſaſſin ! He hos, then, attempted

Schedoni, recollecting himfelf, © but—

while every word ſhe had uttered ſeemed 
to have penetrated his heart. The ſurprize 
which this queſtion awakened in Ellena's 
countenance, recalled him to a conſci- 
ouſneſs of his imprudence; he recollected 
that Ellena did not certainly know the 
office with which Spalatro had been com- 
miſſioned againſt her: and when he con- 
ſidered that this very Spalatro, whom 
Ellena had with ſuch ſimplicity ſuppoſed 
to have, at ſome time, ſpared a life through 
pity, had in truth ſpared her own, and, 
yet more, had been eventually a means 
of preventing him from deſtroying his 
own child, the Confeſſor turned in horror 
from his deſign; all his paſſions changed, 
and he abruptly quitted the court, nor 
pauſed till he reached the furtheſt ex- 


tremity of the avenue, where the guide 


was in waiting with the horſes. 


A recollection of the conduct of Spi- 
latro reſpecting Ellena had thus induced 
Schedoni to ſpare him; but this was all ;

it did not prevail with him to inquire into 
the condition of this man, or to mitigate 
his puniſhment ; and, without remorſe, 
he now left him to his fate. 

With Ellena it was otherwiſe ; though 
ſhe was ignorant of the obligation ſhe 
owed him, ſhe could not know that any 
human being was left under ſuch circum- 
ſtances of ſuffering and ſolitude without 
experiencing very painful emotion ; but, 
conſidering how expeditiouſly Spalatro 
had been able to remove himſelf, ſhe en- 
deavoured to hope that his wound was not 
mortal. 

The travellers, mounting their horſes 
in ſilence, left the ruin, and were for 
ſome time too much engaged by the 
impreſſion of the late occurrences, to 
converſe together. When, at length, El- 
lena inquired the particulars of what had 
paſſed in the avenue, ſhe underſtood that 
Schedoni, on purſuing Spalatro, had ſeen 
him there only for a moment. Spalatro 
B 3 had

had efcaped by ſome way unknown to 
the Conſeſſor, and had regained the in— 
terior of the ruin, while his purſuers 
were yet following the avenue. The cry 
which Ellena had imagined to proceed 
from the interior, was uttcred, as it now 
appeared, by the guide, who, in his 
haſte, had fallen over ſome fragments 
of the wall that lay ſcattered in the 
avenue: the firſt report of arms had 
been from the trombone, which Schedoni 
had diſcharged on reaching the portal; 
and the laſt, when he fired a piſtol, on 
perceiving Spalatro paſling from the court. 

« We have had trouble enough in run- 
ning after this fellow,” ſaid the guide, 
* and could not catch him at laſt, It 
is ſtrange that, if he came to look for 
us, he ſhould run away ſo when he 
had found us! I do not think he meant 
us any harm, after all, elſe he might have 
done it eaſily enough in that dark pallage ; 
inſtead whereof he only took to his heels!“

The guide gave no anſwer, and El- 
lena, who had been attentively obſerv- 
ing him during the whole of this con- 
verſation, perceived that he was now 
conſiderably embarraſſed; ſo that her 
former ſuſpicions as to his integrity be- 
gan to revive, notwithſtanding the ſe- 
veral circumſtances which had occurred 
to render them improbable. There was, 
however, at preſent no opportunity for 
further obſervation, Schedoni having, 
contrary to the advice of the guide, im- 
mediately quickened his pace, and the 
Horſes continuing on the full gallop, till 
a ſleep aſcent compelled them to relax 
their ſpeed. | 

Contrary to his uſual habit, e 
now, while they ſlowly aſcended, ap- 
peared deſirous of converſing with this 
man, and aſked him ſeveral queſtions

in the circumſtances he had already nar- 
rated, from which he might form a 


judgment as to his general character, he 


preſſed his inquiries with a patient mi- 
nuteneſs, that ſomewhat ſurprized Ellena. 


During this converſation, the deep twi- 
light would no longer permit her to 


notice the countenance of either Sche- 


doni, or the guide, but ſhe gave much 


attention to the changing tones of their 
voices, as different circumſtances and 
emotions ſeemed to affect them. It is to 
be obſerved, that during the whole of this 
diſcourſe, the guide rode at the ſide of 
Schedoni.

buildings, before the ſecond and third 
ſhocks laid them alſo in ruins. They 
ran out into the woods for ſafety, and 
found it too, for they happened to take 
a different road from the earthquake. Not 
a ſoul ſuffered, except the Barone, and 
he deſerved it well enough. O! I could 
tell ſuch things that I have heard of 
him! —— 

«© What became of the reſt of the 
family?“ interrupted Schedoni. 

« Why, Signor, they were ſcattered 
here and there, and cvery where; and 
they none of them ever returned to the old 
ipot. No! no! they had ſuffered enough 
there already, and might have ſuffered to 
this day, if the earthquake had not hap- 
pened.“

Ellena.

Once, indeed, his valet happened to—”

It is about the Barone di Cambruſca,

voice, © him that you was aſking me ſo

one ſtormy night in December, .as my 
couſin Franciſco told my father, who told 
me, and he lived in the family at the

haſtily. 

* What I am going to tell, Signor.

may depend upon it, it is all true. My 
father knows I would not believe it my- 
ſelf till—“ 

« Enough of this,” ſaid Schedoni; 
© no more. What family had this Ba- 
rone—had he a wife at the time of this 
deſtructive ſhock ?” 

« Yes, truly, Signor, he had, as I was 
going to tell, if you would but condeſcend 
to have patience.” 

«© The Barone had more need of that, 
friend; I have no wife.” —&lt; The Barone's 
wife had moſt need of it, Signor, as you 
ſhall hear. A good ſoul, they ſay, was 
the Baronefla | but luckily ſhe died many 
years before. He had a daughter, alſo, 
and, young as ſhe was, ſhe had lived too 


long, but for the earthquake which ſet 
her free.

« When we get to the top of this hill, 
Signor, you will ſee it on the next, if 


any light is ſtirring, for there will only 
be the hollow between us. But do not be 


frightened, Signor, the fellow we left can- 


not overtake us. Do you know much 
about him, Signor?“ 


Schedoni inquired whether the trom- 


bone was charged ; and, diſcovering that 
it was not, ordered the man to load im- 


mediately. 
« Why, Signor, if you knew as much 


of him as I do, you could not be more 


afraid!“ ſaid the peaſant, while he ſtopped 
to obey the order. 

* I underſtood that he was a ſtranger 
to you!“ obſerved the Confeflor, with 
ſurprize.

© You ſeem to know a vaſt deal too

doni, in a tone that was meant to filence 
him. 

“ Why, that is juſt what he would 
fay, Signor ; but bad deeds will out, whe- 
ther people like them to be known or not. 
This man comes to our town ſometimes 
to market, and nobody knew where he 
came from for a long while; ſo they ſet 
themſelves to work and found it out at 


laſt.” 


6 We ſhall never reach the ſummit of 


this hill,“ ſaid Schedoni, teſtily. 

« And they found out, too, a great 
many ſtrange things about him,“ con- 
tinued the guide. 

Ellena, who had attended to this diſ- 
courſe with a degree. of curioſity that 
was painful, now liſtened impatiently for 
what might be further mentioned concern- 
ing Spalatro, but without daring to in-

what Jam talking about! I was going 


to begin the ſtory, and it is a pretty long

do do, when the report was firſt ſet a-going ?

* All that I defire to know of my guide 
is, that he does his duty,” replied Sche- 
doni, © that he conducts me ſafely, and 
underſtands when to be filent.” 

To this the man replied nothing, but 
ſlackened his pace, and ſlunk behind his 
reprover. 

The travellers reaching, ſoon after, the 
ſummit of this long hill, looked out for 
the inn of which they had been told;

jet, and no domeſtic light twinkling,

gave ſignal of ſecurity and comfort. They 
deſcended dejectedly into the hollow of the 
mountains, and found themſelves once 
morc immerged in woods. Schedoni 
again called the peaſant to his fide, and 
bade him keep abreaſt of him, but he 
did not diſcourſe; and Ellena was too 
thoughtful to attempt converſation. The 
hints which the guide had thrown out 
reſpecting Spalatro, had increaſed her cu- 
rioſity on that ſubject; but the conduct 


of Schedoni, his impatience, his embar- 


raſſment, and the deciſive manner in 
* which he had put an end to the talk of the 
peaſant, excited a degree of ſurprize, that 
bordered on aſtoniſhment. As ſhe had, 
however, no clue to lead her conjectures 
to any point, ſhe was utterly bewildered 
in ſurmiſe, underſtanding only that Sche- 
doni had been much more deeply con-

The travellers having deſcended into 
the hollow, and commenced the aſcent of 
the oppolite height, without diſcovering 
any ſymptom of a neighbouring town, 
began again to fear that their conductor 
had deceived them. It was now ſo dark 
that the road, though the ſoil was a lime- 
ſtone, could ſcarcely be diſcerned, the 
woods on either fide forming a “ cloſe 
dungeon of innumerous boughs,” that to- 
tally excluded the twilight of the ſtars, 

While the Confeſſor was queſtioning 
the man, with ſome ſeverity, a faint 
ſhouting was heard from a diſtance, and 
he ſtopped the horſes to liſten from what 
quarter it came, ; 

That comes the way we are going, 
Signor,” laid the guide. 

„Hark!“ exclaimed Schedoni, * thoſe 
are ſtrains of revelry!“ 

A confuſed ſound of voices, laugliter, 
and muſical inſtruments, was heard, and, 
as the air blew ſtronger, tamborines and 


flutes were diſtinguiſhed, 


« Oh!

« Oh! Oh! we are near the end of our

followed with alacrity the ſudden ſpeed of 
the Confeſſor; and preſently reaching a 


point of the mountain, where the woods 


3 opened, a cluſter of lights on another

merchandize of every kind, diſpoſed in the 
gayeſt order, were ſpread on all ſides, and

was a band of muſicians, and there a 
group of dancers; on one ſpot the outre 
humour of a zanni provoked the never- 
failing laugh of an Italian rabble; in an- 
other the 1mprov/atore, by the pathos of 
his ſtory, and the perſuaſive ſenſibility of 
his ſtrains, was holding the attention of 
his auditors, as in the bands of magic. 
Further on was a ſtage raiſed for a diſplay 
of fire-works, and near this a theatre, 
where a mimic opera, the © ſhadow of a 
ſhade,” was exhibiting, whence the roar 
of laughter, excited by the principal bufo 
within, mingled with the heterogeneous 
voices of the venders of ice, maccaroni, 
ſherbet, and diavoloni, without. 

The Confeſlor looked upon this ſcene 
with diſappointment and ill-humonr, and 
bade the guide go before him, and ſhew 
the way to the beſt inn ; an office which 


the latter undertook with great glee, though 


he made his way with difficulty, © To 
think I ſhould not know it was the time 
of

truth, I never was at it but once in my 
life, and then I was only three months 
old, ſo it is not ſo ſurpriſing, Signor.“ 


« Make way through the crowd,“ ſaid 


Schedoni. 


« After jogging on ſo long in the dark, 


Signor, with nothing at all to be ſeen,“ 
continued the man, without attending to 
the direction, „then to come, all of a 
ſudden, to ſuch a place as this, why it is 
like coming out of purgatory into paradiſe! 


Well! Signor, you have forgot all your 
quandaries now; you think nothing now 


about that old ruinous place where we 


had ſuch a race aſter the man, that would 
not murder us; but that ſhot I fired did

„Les, Signor, as I was looking over

Aye, 


„

him. But, perhaps, for all that, you

cut me ſhort, when you was in one of 
thoſe quandaries, was only juſt at the be-

„What is all this!” ſaid Schedoni,

«© Ah! Signora! is not this better than

The crowd, which was aſſembled round

dreſſed, were performing, now interrupt- 
ing all further progreſs, the travellers were 
compelled to ſtop at the foot of the plat-

tragedy, but what their ſtrange geſtures, | 
uncouth recitation, and incongruous coun- 
tenances, had transformed into a comedy.

the heart, the Confeſſor furiouſly ſpurred 


his horſe, that he might eſcape from the 


ſcene, but the poor animal was too ſpirit- 
leſs and jaded, to force its way through 
the crowd; and the peaſant, vexed at 
being hurried from a place where, almoſt

grief, and half angry, to obſerve an ani- 
mal, of which he had the care, ill treated,

Scurpont paſſed the night without ſleep. 

The incident of the preceding evening had 

not only renewed the agonies of remorſe, 

but excited thoſe of pride and apprehen- 
ſion. There was ſomething in the con- 
duct of the peaſant towards him, which 
he could not clearly underſtand, though = 
his ſuſpicions were ſufficient to throw his 
mind into a ſtate of the utmoſt perturba- 3 
tion. Under an air of extreme ſimplicity, 3 
this man had talked of Spalatro, had diſ- 
covered that he was acquainted with much 
of his hiſtory, and had hinted that he 
knew by whom he had been employed; 
yet at the ſame time appeared unconſcious, *

Poe se Schedoni's was the maſter-hand, 
which had directed the principal actions of 
5 the ruffian. At other times, his behaviour 
had ſeemed to contradict the ſuppoſition 
of his ignorance on this point; from ſome 
» Circumſtances he had mentioned, it ap- 
peared impoſſible but that he muſt have 
known who Schedoni really was, and 
P. "ven his own conduct had occafionally 
ad emed to acknowledge this, particularly 


le, -when, being interrupted in his hiſtory of 
n Spalatro, he attempted an apology, by 
n- 


fſaying, he did not know it concerned 
1 Schedoni: nor could the conſcious Sche- 
duni believe that the very pointed manner, 
sin which the peaſant had addreſſed him 
at the repreſentation of Virginia, was 
Y, © e accidental. He wiſbed to diſmiſs. 
1. ue man immediately, but it was firſt ne- 
b 1 ceſſary to aſcertain what he knew con- 
e erning him, and then to decide on the 
meaſures to be taken. It was, however, 
I a difficult matter to obtain this inſorma- 


| ( 
tion, without manifeſting an anxiety, 
which might betray him, if the guide had, 
at preſent, only a general ſuſpicion of the 
truth; and no leſs difficult to determine 
how to proceed towards him, if it ſhould 
be evident that his ſuſpicions reſted on 
Spalatro. To take him forward to Naples, 
was to bring an informer to his home ; 
to ſuffer him to return with his diſcovery, 
now that he probably knew the place of 
Schedoni's reſidence, was little leſs ha- 
zardous. His death only could ſecure the 
ſecret. 

Aſter a night paſſed in the tumult of 
ſuch conſiderations, the Conſeſſor ſum- 
moned the peaſant to his chamber, and, 
with ſome ſhort preface, told him he had 
no further oecaſion for his ſervices, add- 
ing, careleſsly, that he adviſed him to be 


on his guard as he re- paſſed the villa, leſt 


Spalatro, who might yet lurk there, 
ſhould revenge upon him the injury he 
had received. According to your ac-

count of him, he is a very dangerous fel- 
low,” added Schedoni; but your inſor- 
formation is, perhaps, erroneous.” _ 

= The guide began, teſtily, to juſtify him- 
£1f for his aflertions, and the Confeſſor 
then endeavoured to draw from him what 
he knew on the ſubject, But, whether 


the man was piqued by the treatment 


he had lately received, or had other rea- 
ſons for reſerve, he did not, at firſt, ap- 
pear ſo willing to communicate as for-

this man, as I was ſaying, came there al] 
of a ſudden, nobody know how ! and the 


place had been ſhut up ever ſince the 
Marcheſe——" 


«© The Marcheſec !” ſaid Schedoni, cold. 
Iy, © what Marcheſe, friend?“ “ Why, 
I mean the Barone di Cambruſca, Signor, 
to be ſure, as I was going to have told 
you, of my own accord, if you would 


only have let me. Shut up ever ſince the | 


Barone L left off there, I think.” 

« I underſtood that the Barone was 
dead!“ obſerved the Confeflor. 

« Yes, Signor, replied the peaſant, 
fixing his eyes on Schedoni; but what 
has his death to do with what I was tel- 
ling? This happened before he died.“ 


Schedoni, ſomewhat diſconcerted by 


this unexpected remark, forgot to reſent 
the

ae familiarity of it. © This man, then, 
"this Spalatro, was connected with the 
Barone di Cambruſca?“ ſaid he.

« Aye,” ſaid Schedoni, the narratir:

a reality; I perſectly accord with then 
in their opinion of this feveriſh old man.“ 

«« But you ſhall hear, Signor; after a 
while they began to think better of it, 
and there was ſome ſtir made about it; 
but what could poor folks do, for nothing 
could be proved! The houſe was ſearch-

could be found! From that time the 
place was ſhut up; till many years aſter

though, I give no credit to your curious

would have you be on your guard. If 
you ſee him, you may depend upon it, 
that he will attempt your life in revenge 
of the injury I have done him. I give 
you, thereſore, in addition to your trom-

Schedoni, while he ſpoke, took an in- 
ſtrument from his boſom, but it was not 
the one he uſually wore, or, at leaſt, that 
he was ſeen to wear. He delivered it to 
the peaſant, who received it with a kind of 
ſtupid ſurpriſe, and then gave him ſome 
directions as to the way in which it ſhould

Schedoni looked gravely at the peaſaut

tainly not, friend, I would only inſtruc | 
you to uſe it to the beſt advantage ;— 


farewell !” 


„Thank you kindly, Signor, but—but 


I think I have no need of it, my trombone

“This will defend you more adroitly,” 
replied Schedoni, refufing to take back 
the ſtiletto, and moreover, while you

fary might uſe his poniard to advantage. 


Keep it, therefore, friend; it will protect

from Naples, till he ſhould think proper 
to acknowledge her. The plan, which he 
had mentioned, ſeemed to her long-ha- 
raſſed mind to exile her for ever from 
happineſs, and all that was dear to her 
affections; it appeared like a ſecond ba. 
niſhment to San Stefano, and every ab- 
beſs, except that of La Pieta, came to her 
imagination in the portraiture of an in- 
exorable jailor. While this ſubject en- 
gaged ber, ſhe was ſummoned to attend 
Schedoni, whom ſhe found impatient to 
enter the carriage, which at this town they 
had been able to procure, Ellena, on 
looking out for the guide, was informed 
that he had already ſet off for his home; 
a circumſtance, for the ſuddenneſs of which 
ſhe knew not how to account.

" nxicty of her mind, if ſhe were placed 
at a diſtance from the ſcenes and the 
people, which affection and early habit 
ſeemed to have conſecrated ; eſpecially at 
this time, when her ſpirits had ſcarcely

vate them, not only quiet, but the con- 


ſciouſneſs of ſecurity, were neceſſary ; a 


conſciouſneſs which it was impoſſible, and 
eſpecially ſo ſoon after her late experience, 
that ſhe could acquire among ſtrangers, 


till they ſhould ceaſe to be ſuch. 


To theſe pleadings Schedoni thoughtfully ; 


attended, but the darkneſs of his aſpect 
did not indicate that his compaſſion was 
touched ; and Ellena proceeded to repre- 


ſent, ſecondly, that which, had ſhe been 


more artful, or leſs diſdainful of cunning, 
ſhe would have urged the firſt. As it was,

Falculation, ſhould have ſuffered fear, on 
mis occaſion, to obſcure his perceptions;

more than an effect of ſelfiſh appre- 


henſions. 


The remainder of the journey, which 
was of ſome days, paſſed without any 


wmarkable occurrence; Schedoni, with 
only ſhort intervals, was fiill enveloped 


in gloom and filence; and Ellena, with 


thoughts engaged by the one ſubject of 


her intereſt, the preſent ſituation and 
circumſtances of Vivaldi, willingly ſub- 


mitted to this prolonged ſtillneſs.

Naples, ſtretching into remoteſt diſtance, *

mountain of that magnificent horizon, 
which encloſed her native landſcape, that 
country which ſhe believed Vivaldi to 


inhabit, ſtood unfolded, how affecting, 
how overwhelming were her ſenſations !

palace, again reviewed and arranged 

every argument, or rather ſpecious cir 
cumſtance, which might induce the Mar. 
cheſa's conſent to the nuptials he ſo muct 38 
defired. His family was noble, though ss 
longer wealthy, and he believed that

Marcheſa might be prevailed with q A 3s

Wo At the palace he was told, that the Mar- 


heſa was at one of her villas on the bay; 
and he was too anxious not to follow her 
Ythither immediately. This delightſul re- 
Kdence was ſituated on an airy promon- 


"ory, that overhung the water, and was 


hearly emboſomed among the woods, that 
Fpread far along the heights, and de- 


Fcended, with great pomp of foliage and 


Zolouring, to the very margin of the 


"Faves. It ſeemed ſcarcely poſſible that 


miſery could inhabit ſo enchanting an 
abode ; yet the Marcheſa was wretched 
midſt all theſe luxuries of nature and 


art, which would have perfected the hap- 


* 


pineſs of an innocent mind! Her heart 
Was poſſeſſed by evil paſſions, and all her 


perceptions were diſtorted and diſcoloured 
8 r them, which, like a dark magician, 
had power to change the faireſt ſcenes 
into thoſe of gloom and deſolation. 


The ſervants had orders to admit father 


Schedoni at all times, and he was ſhewn 


0 into 


1 


into a ſaloon in which the Marcheſa was 
alone. Every object in this apartment 
announced taſte, and even magnificence. 
The hangings were of purple and gold; * 
the vaulted cieling was deſigned by one : 
of the firſt painters of the Venetian ſchool; Ma 
the marble ſtatues that adorned the re. 
ceſſes were not leſs exquiſite, and the 
whole ſymmetry and architecture, airy, 
yet rich; gay, yet chaſtened ; reſembled 
the palace of a fairy, and ſeemed to poſ- 
ſeſs almoſt equal faſcinations. 'The lat- 
tices were thrown open, to admit the pro- 
ſpect, as well as the air loaded with fra- 
grance from an orangery, that ſpread be- 
fore them. Lofty palms and plantains 
threw their green and refreſhing tint over 
the windows, and on the lawn that ſloped f 
to the edge of the precipice, a ſhadow ) 
perſpective, beyond which appeared the 
ample waters 6f the gulf, where the light 
fails of feluccas, and the ſpreading canvas

End gaily-· coloured ſcenery, which ex- 
tends towards Cape Campanella, crowned

4. up with all the magic of Italian ſunſhine. 

Mn The Marcheſa reclined on a ſofa before 
an open lattice ; her eyes were fixed up- 


L Þ 


on the proſpect without, but her attention 
was wholly occupied by the viſions that 
evil paſſions painted to her imagination.

She waved to the attendant to withdraw ; 
while Schedoni, ftalking to a window, 
could with difficulty conceal the pertur. 
bation with which he now, for the firſt 


time, conſciouſly beheld the willing de- 
ſtroyer of his child. Some further com- 


pliment from the Marcheſa recalled him; 
he ſoon recovered all his addreſs, and, ap- 


proaching her, ſaid, 


« Daughter ! you always ſend me away 
a worſe Dominican than I come; I ap- 
proach you with humility, but depat 
elated with pride, and am obliged to 
ſuffer much from ſelf-infliction before I 


can deſcend to my proper level.” 


After ſome other flatteries had been 1 0 
exchanged, a filence of ſeveral moments 
followed, during which neither of the a

" XFtenance, while ſhe ſaid, impatiently—

Schedoni then unfolded, but with re- 
ſcrve, and his uſual art, ſuch particulars

hoped would ſoften the averſion of the

her, in confideration of her ſon's tran-

the idle and improbable tale! Say, rather, 
father, that your reſolution failed in the 
Critical moment, and that you are now . 
anxious to ſorm excuſes to yourſelf for a 


conduct fo puſillanimous.“ 
* I am vob apt to give an eaſy faith to 
appearances,” replied Schedoni, gravely, 
* and ſtill leſs, to ſhrink from the per- 
formance: of any act, which I judge to be 
neceſſary and juſt;' To the laſt intimation, 
I make no reply; it does not become my 
character to vindicate myſelf from an im- 

plication of falſehood.” 
The Marcheſa, perceiving that her paſ- 
fon had betrayed her into imprudence, 
1 con- 


( 106 ) 


condeſcended to apologize for that, which 3 
ſhe termed an effect of her extreme anxi- 
ety, as to what might follow from an act 


of ſuch indiſcreet indulgence ; and Sche- 


doni as. willingly accepted the apology, 2 
each believing the aſſiſtance of the other 


neceſſary to ſucceſs. 
Schedoni then informed her, that he 


had better authority for what he had ad. 
vanced than the aſſertion of Ellena ; and 
he mentioned ſome circumſtances, Which 
proved him to be more anxious for the re- 
putation than the truth of his word. Be- 
lieving that his origin was entirely un- 
known to the Marcheſa, he ventured to 
diſcloſe ſome further particulars of Ellena's | 
family, without apprehending that it could | 


lead to a ſuſpicion of his own. 

The Marcheſa, though neither appeaſed 
or convinced, commanded her feelings ſo 
far as to appear tranquil, while the Con- 
feflor repreſented, with the moſt delicate 
addreſs, the unhappineſs of her ſon, and

to herſelf ſrom an acquieſcence with his 
choice, ſince the object of it was known 


to be worthy of his alliance. He added, 
that, while he had believed the contrary, 
he had proved himſelf as ſtrenuous to 
prevent, as he was now fincere in approv- 
ing their marriage; and concluded with 
gently: blaming her for ſuffering prejudice 
and ſome remains of reſentment to obſcure 


her excellent underſtanding. © Truſting 


to the natural cleargeſs of your percep- 
tions, he added, I doubt not that when 
you have 'maturely conſidered the ſubject, 
every objection will FROG to a conſideration 
of your ſon's happineſs.” 

The earneſtneſs, with which Schedoni 
pleaded for Vivaldi, excited ſome ſur- 
prize; but the Marcheſa, without conde- 
ſcending to reply either to his argument 
or remonſtrance, inquired whether Ellena 
had a ſuſpicion of the defign, with which 
ſhe had been carried into the foreſt of the 

1 Gar-

ing to what theſe queſtions tended, replied, 
with the facility with which he uſually ac. 


commodated his conſcience to his intereſt, 
that Ellena was totally ignorant as to 5 
who were her immediate perſecutors, and 
equally unſuſpicious of any other evil 
having been intended her, than that ofa 


temporary confinement, 


The laſt aſſertion was admitted by the 


Marcheſa to. be probable, till the boldneſs 
of the firſt made her doubt the truth of 
each, and occaſioned her new ſurprize 
and conjecture as to the motive, which 
could induce Schedoni to venture theſe 
untruths. She then inquired where Ellena 


was now diſpoſed of, but he had too 


much prudence to diſcloſe the place of her 


retreat, however plauſible might be the 


air, with which the inquiry was urged;

however,

int as to the pretended diſcovery of his 


Situation in the inquiſition, but reſerved 
to a more favourable opportunity ſuch 
mention, together with a zealous offer of 
his ſervices to extricate the priſoner. The 


ene believing that her ſon was ſtill 
gaged in purſuit of Ellena, made many 


*ZSnquiries concerning him, but without 


expreſſing any ſolicitude for his welfare; 
reſentment appearing to be the only 
emotion ſhe retained towards him. While 


Schedoni replied with cireumſpection to 


5 her queſtions, he urged inquiries of his 


town, as to the manner in which the Mar- 


cheſe endured the long abſence of Vi- 
valdi; thus endeavouring to aſcertain how 


Har he might hereafter venture to appear 
in any efforts for liberating him, and how 


hape his conduct reſpecting Ellena. It

protection from the purſuit of Vivaldi.

Whether the Marcheſa believed Sche- 


doni's aſſertion or not, ſhe expreſſed no

general topics, while the Confeſſor dared 
no more to urge the ſubject of his ſecret 
2 wiſhes; and, having ſupported, for ſome 
- time, a converſation moſt diſſonant with 
his temper, he took his leave, and returned 


to

to Naples. On the way thither, he re- 
viewed, with exactneſs, the late behaviour 
of the Marcheſa, and the reſult of this ex- 


amination was a reſolution— never to re- 


new the ſubject of their converſation, but Þ 
to ſolemnize, without her conſent, the 


nuptials of Vivaldi and Ellena. 
The Marcheſa, meanwhile, on the de.

to her, that Vivaldi had bribed him with 
rich promiſes to promote the marriage, 
which he contributed to thwart ; but, when 
ſhe conſidered the high expectations ſhe 
had herſelf encouraged him to cheriſh, the 
improbability of the conjecture was appa-

La Pieta. 'The Superiour, who had known} 
her from her infancy, and, from the ac: 
quaintance which ſuch long obſervation |? 
afforded, both eſteemed and loved her, 
received Ellena with a degree of fatislac-P : 
tion proportionate to the concern ſhe had

ſuffered when informed of her diſaftrous 


L 9 removal from Villa-Altieri. 


Among the quiet groves of this convent, 


however, Ellena vainly endeavoured to 
moderate her ſolicitude reſpecting the 
ſituation of Vivaldi; for, now that ſhe 
had a reſpite from immediate calamity, ſhe 
1 thought with more intenſe anxiety as to 
what might be his ſufferings, and her fears 
and impatience increaſed, as cach day diſ- 
appointed her expectation of intelligence 
1 from Schedoni. 


If the ſoothings of ſympathy and the 


delicate arts of benevolence could have 
3 reſtored the ſerenity of her mind, Ellena 
N would now have been peaceful; for all 
theſe were offered her by the abbeſs and 
| the ſiſters of the Santa della Pieta. They 
were not acquainted with the cauſe of her 
ſorrow, but they perceived that the was 
2 unhappy, and wiſhed her to be otherwiſe. 
The ſocicty of Our Lady of Pity, was 
ſuch as a convent does not often ſhroud ; 
to the wiſdom and virtue of the Superiour 


the 


(8) 
the ſiſterhood was principally indebted for 
the harmony and happineſs, which diſtin- 
guiſhed them. This lady was a ſhining 
example to governeſſes of religious houſes, 
and a ſtriking inftance of the influence, 
which a virtuous mind may acquire over 
others, as well as of the extenſive good 
that it may thus diffuſe. She was dig- 
nified without haughtineſs, religious with- 


out bigotry, and mild, though deciſive ö 1 


and firm. She poſſeſſed penetration to 
diſcover what was juſt, reſolution to ad- 
here to it, and temper to practiſe it with 
gentleneſs and grace; ſo that even correc- 


tion from her, aſſumed the winning air f 


courteſy: the perſon, whom ſhe admo- 
niſhed, wept in forrow for the offence, 
inſtead of being ſecretly irritated by the 
reproof, and loved her as a mother, rather 
than feared. her as a judge. Whatever 
might be her failings, they were effectually 
coneealed by the general henevolence of 
her e's and the harmony of her mind; 
a har- 


(1190 


a harmony, not the effect of torpid feel- 
Sings, but the accompliſhment of correct 
and vigilant judgment. Her religion was 
neither gloomy nor bigotted ; it was 
the ſentiment of a grateful heart offering 

itſelf up to a Deity, who delights in the 
pvappineſs of his creatures; and ſhe con- 
formed to the cuſtoms of the Roman 
church, without ſuppoſing a faith in all 
| | of them to be neceſſary to ſalvation. This 
opinion, however, ſhe was obliged to con- 
Sceal, left her very virtue ſhould draw 
upon her the puniſhment of a crime, from 
ſome fierce eccleſiaſtics, who contradicted 
in their practice the very eſſential princi- 
pfles, which the chriſtianity they profeſſed 
would have taught them. 


e In her lectures to the nuns ſhe ſeldom 
1 touched upon points of faith, but ex- 
er ö plained and enforced the moral duties, 
ly particularly ſuch as were moſt practicable 


of $ in the ſociety to which ſhe belonged ; ſuch 
1; s tended to ſoften and barmonize the af-

ſections, to impart that repoſe of mind, 9 | 
which perſuades to the practice of fiſterly i 


kindneſs, univerſal charity, and the moſt 
pure and elevated devotion. When ſhe 
ſpoke of religion, it appeared ſo intereſt- 
ing, ſo beautiful, that her attentive auditors, 
revered and loved it as a friend, a refiner 
of the heart, a ſublime conſoler ; and ex- 
prienced ſomewhat of the meek and holy 
ardour, which may belong to angelic na- 
tures. 

The ſociety appeared like a large family, 
of which the lady abbeſs was the mother, 
rather than an aſſemblage of ſtrangers ; and 
particularly when gathered around her, 
they liſtened to the evening ſermon, which 
ſhe delivered with ſuch affectionate intereſt, 
ſuch perſuaſive eloquence, and ſometimes 
with ſuch pathetic energy, as few hearts 
could reiiſt. 

She encouraged in her convent every in- 
nocent and liberal purſuit, which might 
fweeten the auſterities of confinement,

Paulo was permitted to harangue in

to exerciſe upon others: and this virtuous, 
indignation gave a loftineſs, a calm heroic 
grandeur to his mind, which never, for a 
moment, forſook him, except when he 
conjectured what might be the ſufferings 
of Ellena. Then, his fortityde and mag- 
nanimity failed, and his tortured ſpirit roſe 
almoſt to frenzy. 

On this, his ſecond examination, he 
was urged by the ſame dark queſtions,

again threatened with the torture, and

On the way to this dreadful abode, a 
| perſon paſſed him in one of the avenues, 
el whoſe air and figure he thought he had 
ſome recollection; and, as the ſtranger

be the prophetic monk, who had haunted 
the ruins of Paluzzi. In the firſt moment 
of ſurprize, Vivaldi loſt his preſence of 
mind ſo far, that he made no attempt to 
interrupt him. In the next inſtant, how- 
ever, he pauſed and looked back, with an 
intention of ſpeaking ; but this myſterious 
perſon was already at the extremity of the 
avenue. Vivaldi however called, and be- 
fought him to ſtop; when, without either 
fpeaking or turning his head, he imme- 
diately diſappeared beyond a door that 
opened at his approach. Vivaldi, on at- 
tempting to take the way of the monk, 
was withheld by his guards, and, when y 
he inquired who was the ſtranger he had . a1 
ſeen, the officials aſked, in their turn, 
what ſtranger he alluded to.

Fey a meſſage, however conciſe and harm-

© 10us inquiſitors againſt him, and might be 
vrged as a new preſumption of his guilt. 
Theſe conſiderations, together with the 
diſtruſt which the inconſiſtency of his 
VvVifitor's aſſertions, and the occaſional em- 
barraſſment of his manner, had excited, 
determined Vivaldi to reſiſt the temptation 
now offered to him; and the ſtranger, 
having received his thanks, reluctantly 
EZ withdrew, obſerving, however, that ſhould 
F any unforeſeen circumſtance detain him in 
the Inquiſition longer than he had reaſon 
© to expect, he ſhould beg leave to pay him 
another viſit. In reply to this, Vivaldi 
only bowed, but he remarked that the 
ſtranger's countenance altered, and that 
ſome dark brooding appeared to cloud his 
mind, as he quitted the chamber. 855

examination, from which he was diſmiſſed 
as before; and ſome weeks of ſolitude and 
of heavy uncertainty ſucceeded, after 
which he was a fourth time called up to 
the table of the Holy Office. It was then 
ſurrounded by inquiſitors, and a more 
than uſual ſolemnity en, in the pro- 
ceedings. IF 

As proofs of Vivaldi's innocence had 
not been obtained, the ſuſpicions of his 
examiners, of courſe, were not removed; 
and, as he. perſiſted in denying the truth 
of the charge which he underſtood would 
be exhibited againſt him, and refuſed to 
make any confeſſion of crimes, it was or- 
dered that he ſhould, within three houre, 
be put to the gugſtion. Till then, Vivaldi 
was once more diſmiſſed to his priſon- 
chamber. His reſolution remained unſha- 
ken, but he could not look, unmoved, 
upon the horrors which might be preparing 
for him. The interval of expedation be-

ment of this preliminary puniſhment, was, 
indeed, dreadful. The ſeeming ignominy 
of his ſituation, and his ignorance as to the 
degree of torture to be apphed, overcame 
the calmneſs he had before exhibited, and 
as he paced his cell, cold damps, which 
hung upon his forehead, betrayed the agony 
of his mind. It was not long, however, 
that he ſuffered from a ſenſe of 1 ignomny 5 
his better judgment ſhewed him, that in- 
nocence cannot ſuffer diſgrace ſrom any 
ſituation or circumſtance, and he once 
more reſumed the courage. and the firm 
neſs which belong to virtue. 

It was about midnight, that Vivaldi 
heard ſteps approaching, and a murmur 


| of voices at the door of his cell, He un- 
derſtood by theſe that perſons were coming 
| to ſummon him to the torture. The door 


was unbarred, and two men, habited in 


: black, appeared at it. Without ſpeaking, 
they advanced, and throwing over him a 


angular kind of mantle, led him from the 
chamber.

Along the galleries, and other avenue; 
through which they paſſed, not any perſof 
was ſeen, and, by the profound ſtillneſs 
that reighed, it ſremed as if death had al- 
ready anticipated his work in theſe regions 
of horror, and had condemned alike the 
tortured and the torturer. 

They deſcended to the large hall, where 
Vial had waited on the night of his en- 
trance, and thence through an avenue, 
and down a long flight of ſteps, that led 
to ſubterranean chambers. His conduc: 
tors did not utter a ſyllable during the 
whole progreſs ; Vivaldi knew too wel 
that queſtions would only ſubject him to 
greater ſeverity, and he aſked none. 

The doors, through Which they paſſed, 
regularly opened at the touch of an iron 


rod, carried by one of the officials, and 3 1 
without the appearance of any perſon. E gu

9 of the place did not allow it to be aſcer- 

tained; and, having reached an iron door, 
they ſtopped. One of the officials ſtruck 
upon it three times with the rod, but it 

; did not open as the others had done. 
While they waited, Vivaldi thought he 
heard, from within, low intermitting 
&amp;” ſounds, as of perſons in their laſt extre- 
mity, but, though within, they appeared 
to come from a diſtance. His whole 
EZ heart was chilled, not with fear, for at 
that moment he did not remember him- 
ſelf, but with horror.

Several minutes had elapſed, when tone: 
of deep voices. arouſed the attention of 
Vivaldi. They were loud and hoarſe, and 
ſpoke in a language .unknown to him, 
At the ſounds, the official immediately 
extinguiſhed his torch. The voices drew 
nearer, and, the door again unfolding, 
two figures ſtood before Vivaldi, which, 
ſhewn by a glimmering light within, ſtruck 
him with aſtoniſhment and diſmay. They 
were clothed like his conductors, in 
black, but in a different faſhion, for their 
habits were made cloſe to the ſhape. 
Their faces were entirely . concealed be- 
neath a very peculiar kind of.cow], Which 
deſcended from the head to the feet ; and 
their eyes only were viſible : through ſmall 
openings contrived for the fight. It oc- 
curred to Vivaldi that theſe men were tor- 
turers; their appearance was worthy of 
demons. Probably they were thus habit- | 
ed, that the perſons, whom they afflicted, 
might not know them; or, perhaps, it was 
only 


10 


only for the purpoſe of ſtriking terror upon 
the minds of the accuſed, and thus com- 
pelling them to confeſs without further 
difficulty. Whatever motive might have 
occaſioned their horrific appearance, and 
whatever was their office, Vivaldi was de- 
lirvered into their hands, and in the ſame 
moment heard the iron door ſhut, which 
encloſed him with them in a narrow paſ- 
age, gloomily lighted by a lamp ſuſpended 
" EX from the arched roof. They walked in 
" EX filence on each fide of their prifoner, and 
8 came to a ſecond door, which admitted 
= them inſtantly into another paſſage. A 
third door, at a ſhort diſtance, admitted 
them to a third avenue, at the end of 
which one of his myſterious guides ſtruck 
upon a gate, and they ſtopped. The un- 
WE ccrtain ſounds that Vivaldi had fancied he 
heard, were now more audible, and he diſ- 
tinguiſhed, with inexpreſſible horror, that 
they were uttered by perſons ſuffering. 
The gate was, at length, opened by a 
figure habited like his conductors, and two 
| G 2 other 


{ 148 ) 
other doors of iron, placed very near each 
other, being alſo unlocked, Vivaldi found 
himſelf in a ſpacious chamber, the walls of 
which were hung with black, duſkily 
lighted by lamps, that gleamed in the loſty Þ 
vault, Immediately on his entrance, a F 
ſtrange ſound ran along the walls, and F 
echoed among other vaults, that appeared, 
by the progreſs of the ſound, to extend far Þ 
beyond this. 
It was not immediately that Vivaldi could 
ſufficiently recollect himſelf to obſerve any Þ - 
object before him; and, even when he did | 
ſo, the gloom. of the place prevented his aſ. Þ 
certaining many appearances. Shadowy 


countenances and uncertain forms ſeemed 7 
to flit through the duſk, and many inſiru- 2 
ments, the application of which he did not 
comprehend, firuck him with horrible ſuſ. 7 
picions. Still he heard, at intervals, hal- 


ſuppreſſed groans, and was looking round 7 


to diſcover the wretched people, from whom F 


they were extorted, when a voice from a re- : 
mote part of the chamber called on him to 
advance. The Wi 


— 


bf 


( 149 ) 


The diſtance, and the obſcurity of the ſpot 
whence the voice iſſued, had prevented Vi- 
valdi from noticing any perſon there, and 
he was now ſlowly obeying, when, on a 
ſccond ſummons, his conductors ſeized his 
arms, and hurried him forward. 

In a remote part of this extenſive cham- 
ber, he perceived three perſons ſeated under 
a black canopy, on chairs raiſed ſeveral ſteps 
from the floor, and who appeared to preſide 
there in the office of either judges or exa- 
miners, or directors of the puniſhments, 
Below, at a table, fat a ſecretary, over whom 
was ſuſpended the only lamp, that could 
enable him to commit to paper what ſhould 
occur during the examination. Vivaldi now 
underſtood that the three perſons who com- 
poſed the tribunal were the vicar-general, 
or grand inquiſitor, the advocate of the ex- 
chequer, and an ordinary inquiſitor, who 
was ſeated between the other two, and who 
appeared more eagerly to engage in the 
duties of his cruel office. A portentous 
63 obſcurity 


( x50 ) 
obſcurity enveloped alike their perſons and 


their proceedings. 

At ſome diſtance from the tribunal ſtood 
2a large iron frame, which Vivaldi conjec- 
tured to be the rack, and near it another, 
reſembling, in ſhape, a coffin, but, happily, 
he could not diſtinguiſh, through the re- 
mote obſcurity, any perſon undergoing ac- 
tual ſuffering. In the vaults beyond, how- 
ever, the diabolical decrees of the inquiſi- 
tors ſeemed to be fulfilling ; for, whenever 
a diftant door opened for a moment, ſounds 
of lamentation iſſued forth, and men, 


whom he judged to be familiars, habited 


like thoſe, who ſtood befide him, were ſeen 
paſſing to and fro within. 

Vivaldi almoſt believed himſelſ in the in- 
fernal regions; the diſmal aſpect of this 
place, the horrible preparation for puniſh- 
ment, and, above all, the diſpoſition and 
appearance of the perſons that were ready 
to inflict it, confirmed the reſemblance.

Ein 
afflict a fellow being, who had never inju- 
red, or even offended him; that, unſwayed 


by paſſion, he ſhould deliberately become 
EZ the means of torturing him, appeared to 


Vivaldi nearly incredible! But, when he 
looked at the three perſons who compoſed 
the tribunal, and conſidered that they had 
not only voluntarily undertaken: the cruel 
office they fulfilled, but had probably 
long regarded it as the ſummit of their 
ambition, his aſtoniſhment and 2 ; 
tion were unbounded, 

The grand inquiſitor, having again cal- 
led on Vivaldi by name, admoniſhed him 
to confeſs the truth, and avoid the ſuffer- 
ing that awaited him. 

As Vivaldi had on former examinations 
ſpoken the truth, which was not believed, 
he had no chance of eſcaping preſent ſuffer- 
ing, but by aſſerting falſchood : in doing 
ſo, to avoid ſuch monſtrous injuſtice and 
cruelty, he might, perhaps, have been juſ- 
ufied,. had it been certain that ſuch aſſer- 

6 4. tion 


( 486-3 


tion could affect himſelf alone; but fincs 
he knew that the conſequence muſt extend 
to others, and, above all, beheved that 
Ellena di Roſalba muft be involved in it, 
he did not heſitate for an inſtant to dare 
whatever torture his firmneſs might pro- 
voke. But even it morality could have for- 
given falſehood in ſuch extraordinary cir- 
cumſtances as theſe, pohcy, after all, 
would have forbidden it, fince a diſcovery 
of the artifice would probably have lcd to 
the final deſtruction of the accuſed perſon, 

Of Ellena's fituation he would now 
have aſked, however deſperate the quel- 
tion; would again have aſſerted her inno- 
cence, and ſupplicated for compaſſion, 
even to inquiſitors, had he not perceived 
that, in doing fo, he fhould only furnith 
them with a more exquiſite means of 
torturing him than any other they could 
apply; for if, when all the terrors of his 
| ſoul concerning her were underſtood, they 


ſhould threaten to encreaſe her ſufferings,

as the puniſhment of what was termed his 
obſtinacy, they would, indeed, become the 
maſters of his integrity, as well as of his 
perſon. 

The tribunal again, and repeatedly, 
urged Vivaldi to confeſs himſelf guilty ; 
and the inquiſitor, at length, concluded 
with ſaying, that the judges were inno- 
cent of whatever conſequence might enſue 
ſrom his obſtinacy; ſo that, if he expired 
beneath his ſufferings, himſelf only, not 
they, would have occaſioned his death. 

„J am innocent of the charges, which 
| underftand are urged againſt me,” ſaid 
Vivaldi, with ſolemnity; „I repeat, that 
Jam innocent! If, to eſcape the horrors 
of theſe moments, I could be weak enough 
to declare myſelf guilty, not all your racks 
could alter truth, and make me fo, except 
in that aſſertion. The conſequence of your 
your tortures, therefore, be upon your own . 
heads!“ | 

While Vivaldi ſpoke, the vicar-general 
liſtened with attention, and, when he 
G.. had

had ceaſed to ſpeak, appeared to medi- 
tate; but the inquiſitor was irritated by 
the boldneſs of his ſpeech, inſtead of be- 
ing convinced by the juſineſs of his re- 
preſentation ; and made a fignal for the 
officers to prepare for the gugſlion. While 
they were obeying, Vivaldi obſerved, not- 
withſtanding the agitation he ſuffered, a 
perſon croſs the chamber, whom he im- 
mediately knew to be the ſame that had 
paſſed him in the avenue of the inquiſi- 
tion on a former night, and whom he had 
then fancied to be the myſterious ſtranger 
of Paluzzi. Vivaldi now fixed his eyes 
upon him, but his own peculiar fituation 
prevented his feeling the intereſt he had 
formerly ſuffered concerning him. 

The figure, air, and ſtalk, of this per- 
ſon were ſo ſtriking, and fo ſtrongly re- 
ſembled thoſe of the monk of Paluzzi, 
that Vivaldi had no longer a doubt as to 
their identity. He pointed him out to one 
of the officials, and inquired who he was.

# While he ſpoke, the ſtranger was paſſing - 
forward, and, before any reply was given, 
a door leading to the further vaults ſhut 
him from view. Vivaldi, however, re- 

WT peated the inquiry, which the official ap- 

peared unable to anſwer, and a reproof 

BE from the tribunal, reminded him that he 


' muſt not aſk queſtions there. Vivaldi 
obſerved that it was the grand inquiſitor

official immediately changed.

had conducted Vivaldi into the chamber,

\c interrogated by the inquiſitor. 


8. . © Was you ever in the church of the

« Yes,” ;

( 136 ) 
© Yes, replied Vivaldi. 

* Did you ever expreſs there à con- 
tempt of the Catholic faith?“ 

4 Never,” ſaid Vivaldi. 

Neither by word or action?“ conti- 
nued the inquiſitor. 

« Never, by either!“ 

% Recollect yourſelf,” added the in- 
quifitor. © Did you never inſult there ; 
miniſter of our moſt holy church?“ 

Vivaldi was filent : he began to perceive 
the real nature of the charge which was to 
be urged againſt him, and that it was too 
plauſible to permit his eſcape from the 
puniſhment, which is adjudged for hereſy, 
Queſtions ſo direct and minute had never 


yet been put to him ; they had been reſery- 
ed for a moment when it was believed he 


could not evade them; and the real charge 

had been concealed from him, that he 
might not be prepared to elude it. 

„ Anſwer !”* repeated the inquiſitor.— 

* Did you ever inſult a miniſter of the 

Catholic 


inn 


Catholic faith, in the church of the Spirito 
Santo, at Naples?“ | 

« Did you not inſult him while he was 
performing an act of holy penance ?” faid 
another voice. 

Vivaldi ſtarted; for he inſtantly recol- 
lected the well-known tones of the monk 
of Paluzzi. Who aſks the queſtion?“ 
demantled Vivaldi. 

« It is you who are to anſwer here, 
reſumed the inquiſitor. Anſwer to what 
J have required.”

inſult and menace, force a pious brother.

— in which he had engaged. himſelf? Did 
1 pvyou not compel: him to quit the church, 
ic and fly for refuge to his conyvent?ꝰ 

Ip cc No 


( 158 ) 


No,“ replied Vivaldi. © Tis true, he 
left the church, and'that in conſequence 
of my conduct there; but the conſequence 
was not neceſſary ; if he had only replied 
to my inquiry, or promiſed to reſtore her 
of whom he had treacherouſly robbed me, 
he might have remained quietly in the 
church till this moment, had that depend-- 
ed upon my ſorbearance.“ 

« What!” ſaid the vicar-general, 
« would you have compelled him to ſpeak, 
when he was engaged in filent penance ? 
You confeſs, that you occaſioned. him to 
leave the church. That is enough.” 

« Where did you firſt ſee Ellena di Ro- 
falba ?” ſaid the voice, which had ſpoken 
once before. 

« demand again, who gives the 
queſtion,” anſwered Vivaldi. 

« Recollect yourſelf,” faid the inquiſitor, 
« a criminal may not make a demand.” 

*« do not perceive the connection be-

« Let the ſame perſon aſk it,” replied 


Vivaldi.

mer voice. 

In the church of San Lorenzo, at 
Naples,” rejoined Vivaldi, with a heavy 
ſigh, „I firſt beheld Ellena di Rofalba.” 

Was ſhe then profeſſed?” aſked the 
vicar-general. | 

She never accepted the veil,” replied 
Vivaldi, „nor ever intended to do ſo.” 

% Where did ſhe reſide at that period?” 

« She lived with a relative at Villa-Al-

the machinations of a monk occaſioned 
her to be torn from her home, and con-

tors, all the feelings of his heart. 

The name of the monk?“ ſaid the 
ſtranger, earneſtly. 

If I miſtake not,” replied Vivaldi, 
« you are already acquainted with it. 
The monk 1s called father Schedom. He 
is of the Dominican convent of the Spirito 
Santo, in Naples, the ſame who accuſes 
me of having inſulted him in the church 
of that name.” 

* How did you know him for your ac- 
cuter ?” aſked the ſame voice. 

* Becauſe he is my only enemy,“ re- 
plied Vivaldi. 

© Your enemy!“ obſerved the inquiii- 
tor; © a former depoſition ſays, you were 
unconſcious of having one! You are in- 
conſiſtent in your replies.“ 

* You were warned not to vifit Villa- 
Altieri,“ ſaid the unknown perſon. Why 
did you not profit by the warning?“ 

6 I was

« | was warned by yourſelf,” anſwered 


vivaldi. Now I know you well.” 


„By me!” ſaid the ſtranger, in a ſo- 


lemn tone. 


« By you!“ repeated Vivaldi: “you, 


5 who alſo foretold the death of Signora 
Bianchi; and you are that enemy that 
father Schedoni, by whom ] am accuſed.“ 


«© Whence come theſe queſtions?“ de- 


; manded the vicar- general. Who has 
been authoriſed thus to interrogate the 
# priſoner ?” 


No reply was made. A buſy hum of 


E voices from the tribunal ſacceeded the 
EZ filence. At length, the murmuring ſub- 
ſided, and the monk's voice was heard 
again. 


« | will declare thus much,“ it faid, 


; addreſſing Vivaldi; “ I am not father 


Schedoni.“ 

The peculiar tone and emphaſis, with 
which this was delivered, more than the 
allertion itſelf, perſuaded Vivaldi that 

the 


( 162) 


the ſtranger ſpoke truth; and, though he 
ſtill recognized the voice of the monk of 
Paluzzi, he did not know it to be that of 
Schedoni. Vivaldi was aſtoniſhed ! He 
would have tora the veil' from his eyes, 
and once more viewed this myſterious 
ranger, had his hands been. at liberty, 
As it was, he could only conjure him to 
reveal his name; and the motives for his 
former conduct. 

«© Who is come amongſt us?“ ſaid the 
vicar-general, in- the voice of a perſon, 
who means to infpire others with the awe 
he himſelf ſuffers. 4 

« Who is come amongſt us?” he re

By comparing thoſe with the preſent, he 
endeavoured to draw a more certain con.

and his motives ſor the very extraordinary 
conduct he had purſued. The firſt ap- 
pearance of this ſtranger among the ruins 
of Paluzzi, when he had ſaid that Vivaldi 
ſteps were watched, and had cautioned 


him againſt returning to Villa-Altieri, 


was recalled to his mind. Vivaldi recon- 
fidered, alſo, his ſecond appearance ou 
the ſame ſpot, an;l his ſecond warning; 
the circumſtances, which had attended his 
own adventures within the fortreſs ,—the 


monk's prediction of Bianchi's death, and 
his evil tidings reſpecting Ellena, at the 


very hour when ſhe had been ſeized and 
carried from her home. The longer he 
conſidered theſe ſeveral inſtances, as they 


were now connected in his mind, with the

BI Vivaldi's viſits to Villa-Altieri. Being 


thus an agent in the events of which he 
had warned Vivaldi, he was too well 
enabled to predict them. Vivaldi pauſed

Of the converſation, however, which he 


had afterwards held with the Confeſſor in

many particulars, that ſerved to renew his

Some particulars, alſo, of the ſtran- 
ger's conduct did not agree with what 
might have been expected from Sche- 
doni, even though the Confeſſor had 
really been Vivaldi's enemy; a circum- 
Nance which the latter was no longer per- 
mitted to doubt. Nor did thoſe particular 
circumſtances accord, as he was inclined 
to believe, with the manner of a being of 
this world ; and, when Vivaldi confidered 
the ſuddenneſs and myſtery with which 
the ſtranger had always appeared and re-

Satisfied with this concluſion, he again 
laid his head on his pillow of ſtraw, and

his waking thoughts ſtill haunted his ima-

he had this night recognized as that of the 
prophet of Paluzzi, appeared before him, 
Vivaldi, on perceiving the figure of this 
unknown, felt, perhaps, nearly the ſame 
degrees of awe, curiofity, and impatience, 
that he would have ſuffered, had he beheld 
the ſubſtance of this ſhadow. The monk, 
whoſe face was ſtill ſhrouded, he thought 
advanced, till, having come within a few 
paces of Vivaldi, he pauſed, and, liſting 
the awful cowl that had hitherto concealed 
him, diſcloſed—not the countenance of 
Schedoni, but one which Vivaldi did not 
recollect ever having ſeen before! It was

recollected the obſcure and imperfect ſtory 
which Paulo had related while they were 
confined in the dungeon of Paluzzi, re- 
ſpecting a confeſſion made in the church 
of the Black Penitents; but he could not 
preſume to affirm that it concerned Sche- 
doni. He remembered alſo the monk's 
garments, ſtained with blood, which he 
had diſcovered in the vaults of that fort. 
The conduct of the myſterious being, who

particulars of his own adventures there, 
paſſed like a viſion over his memory. His 
mind reſembled the glaſs of a ' magician, 
on which the apparitions of long-buried 
events ariſe, and, as they fleet away, point 
portentouſly to ſhapes half veiled in the 
duſkineſs of futurity. An unuſual dread 
ſeized upon him ; and a ſuperſtition, ſuch 
as he had never before admitted in an 
equal degree, ufurped his judgment. He 
looked up to the ſhadowy countenance of 
the ſtranger ; and almoſt believed he be- 
held an inhabitant of the world of ſpirits. 

The monk ſpoke again, repeating in a 
ſeverer tone, Did you never hear any 
thing extraordinary concerning father 
Schedoni?“ 

Is it reaſonable,” ſaid Vivaldi, recol- 
lecting his courage, © that I ſhould an-

« Though you have not ſeen him enter

perhaps, recollect ſuch a perſon, as an in-

San Dominico forbid !“ 

Vivaldi, ſurprized at this exclamation, 
inquired the reaſon ſor it. 
I know him not,” replied the centinel, 
with emotion, and he abruptly left the 
priſon. Whatever conſideration might oc- 
caſion this ſudden departure, his affertion 
that he had been for three years a guard of 
the Inquiſition could ſcarcely be credited, 
fince he had held fo long a dialogue with 
a priſoner, and was, apparently, inſenſible 
of the danger he incurred by ſo doing.

worſt, from having thwarted the deſigns 
of a perſon apparently ſo malignant : but 
he exulted in the rectitude which had 
preſerved him from debaſement, and, with 
the magnanimous enthuſiaſm of virtue, 
he almoſt welcomed ſufferings which 
would prove the firmneſs of his juſlice 
towards an enemy ; for he determined to 
brave every thing, rather than impute 
to Schedoni circumſtances, the truth of 
which he poſſciſed no means of aſcer- 
taining. 

While Vivaldi was conducted, as on 


the preceding night, through many pa. 


fages, he endeavoured to diſcover, by 


their length, and the abruptneſs of their WW 
turnings, whether they were the ſame he 
had traverſed before. Suddenly, one of 
his . conductors cried * Steps!“ It was

his ſteps returned, he judged that he was 
walking over vaults. The footſteps of 
the centinels who had followed from the 
cell were no longer heard, and he ſeemed 
F to be left with his conductors only. A

round him. The menace of the monk, 
that he ſhould meet him in the chamber 
of death, frequently occurred to Vivaldi. 

His conductors ſtopped in this vault, 
and ſeemed to hold a conſultation, but 
they ſpoke in ſuch low accents, that their 
words were not diſtinguiſhable, except 
a few unconneRed ones, that Hinted of 
more than Vivaldi could comprehend, 
He was, at length, again led forward ; and 
foon after, he heard the heavy grating of 
hinges, and perceived that he was paſ- 
fing through ſeyeral doors, by the fitu- 
ation of which judging they were the fame 
he had entered the night before, he con- 
cluded, that he was going to the ball of 
the tribunal. 

His conductors ſtopped again, and 
Vivaldi beard the iron rod ſtrike three 
times upon a door; immediately a ſtrange 
voice ſpoke from within, and the door 
wis uncloſed. He paſſed on, and ima- 
gined that he was admitted into a ſpa- 

ciou

cious vault; for the air was freer, and his 
ſteps ſounded to a diſtance. 


nn Preſently, a voice, as on the preceding

« Reſpect truth!“ ſaid another voice 
from the tribunal, and Vivaldi fancied he 
diſtinguiſhed the tones of the monk, 
He pauſed a moment, and the exhorta- 
tion was repeated. Vivaldi then related 
what the ſtranger had ſaid concerning the 
family of Schedoni, and the diſguiſe 
which the father had aſſumed in the con- 
vent of the Spirito Santo; but forbore 
even to name the penitentiary Anſaldo,

or the condition of my informer, and 
that I never even beheld his face, till the 
period when he ſpoke of father Schedoni.“ 

“ 'Tremble !“ repeated the ſame low, 
but emphatic voice in his ear. Vivaldi 
ſtarted, and turned involuntarily towards 
the ſound, though his eyes could not al- 
fiſt his curioſity. 

* You did well to ſay, that you had 
ſomething extraordinary to add,” ob- 
ſerved the inquifitor. * "Tis evident, allo, 
that you expected ſomething extraordinary 
from your judges, ſince you ſuppoſed they 
would credit theſe aſſertions.“ 

Vivaldi was too proud to attempt the 
juſtifying himſelf againſt fo groſs an ac- 
cuſation, or to make any reply. 

«© Why do you not ſummon father An- 
ſaldo!” ſaid the voice. © Remember my 
words!“ | 

Vivaldi, again awed by the voice, he- 
ſitated, for an inſtant, how to act, and in 
that inſtant his courage returned. 

| &amp;« My

Vivaldi, boldly; I know his voice !

ſitor. No perſon ſpoke but myſelf !” 
{ « Whoſe voice?“ ſaid the vicar- gene- 
ral. TE 
The voice was cloſe beſide me,“ re- 
pled Vivaldi. It ſpoke low, but I 
Knew it well.” 
„This is either the cunning, or the 
| frenzy of deſpair !” obſerved the vicar- 
general.

| aldi: ; * and I ſupplicate that my eyes

enemy.“ | 
The tribunal, after a long private c. con- 
lation, granted the requeſt; the veil 
| 12 Was 


( 196 ) 


was withdrawn, and Vivaldi perceived 
beſide him—only the familiars! Their 
faces, as is uſual, were concealed. I 
appeared that one of theſe torturers muſt 
be the myſterious enemy, who purſued 
him, if, indeed, that enemy was an in- 
habitant of the earth! and Vivaldi re- 
queſted that they might be ordered to 
uncover their features. He was ſternhy 
rebuked for ſo preſumptuous a requiſition, 
and reminded of the inviolable law and 
faith, which the tribunal had pledged, 
that perſons appointed to their awful of- 
fice ſhould never be expoſed to the re- 
venge of the criminal, whom it might be | 
their duty to puniſh. | 

| 


Their duty!“ exclaimed Vivaldi, 
thrown from his guard by ſtrong indig- 
nation. And is faith held ſacred with 
demons !” ? 

Without awaiting the order of the tri- 
bunal, the familiars immediately covered We 
Vivaldi's face with the veil, and he ſclt WW

voured, however, to diſentangle his hands,

N I bold, and again unveiled his eyes; but 

the familiars were inſtantly ordered to ro- 

| 1 place the veil. 

* The inquiſitor bade Vivaldi to recollect 
in whoſe preſence he then was, and to 
© dread the puniſhment which his reſiſtance 
had incurred, and which would be in- 
flicted without delay, unlefs he could 
© give ſome inftance, that might tend to 
prove the truth of his late affertions. 

= © If you expect that I ſhould ſay 
more,“ replied Vivaldi, © I claim, at 
| leaſt, protection from tlie unbidden vio- 
© lence of the men who guard me. If 


A Y they are ſuffered, at their pleaſure, to

ill be inflexibly filent ; and, fince I muſt

The vicar-general, or, as he is called,

the degree of protection he claimed, and 
demanded, at the fame time, what were 
the words he had juſt heard. 
Vivaldi confidered, that, though jut. 
tice bade him avoid accuſing an enemy 
of ſuſpicious circumſtances, concerning 
which he had no proof, yet, that neither 
juſtice nor common ſenſe required he 
ſhould make a ſacrifice of himſelf to the 
dilemma in which he was placed: he, 
therefore, without further ſeruple, ac- 
 knowledged, that the voice had bidden him 
require of the tribunal to ſummon one 
father Anſaldo, the grand penitentiary 
of the Santa del Pianto, near Naples, 
and allo father Schedoni, who was to 
anſwer to extraordinary charges, Which 
would be brought againſt him by An 
ſaldo. Vivaldi anxiouſly and repeated 
declared, that he knew not the nature 0! 
the charges, nor that any juſt grounds to! 
them exiſted. - | 

- Theſe aſſertions ſeemed to throw the 
tribunal into new perplexity. Vivaldi

heard their buſy voices in low debate, 
which continued for a conſiderable time. 
In this interval, be had leiſure to perceive 
the many improbabilities that either of the 
familiars ſhould be the ſtranger who ſo my- 
ſteriouſly haunted him; and among theſe 
was the circumſtance of his having reſided 
ſo long at Naples. 

The tribunal, after ſome time had 
elapſed in conſultation, proceeded on the 
examination, and Vivaldi was aſked what 
he knew of father Anſaldo. He imme- 
diately replied, that Anſaldo was an utter 
ſtranger to him, and that he was not even 
acquainted with a ſingle perſon reſiding in 


the Santa del Pianto or who had any 


knowledge of the penitentiary. 

„How!“ ſaid the grand inquiſitor, 
© You forget that the perſon, who bade 
you require of this tribunal to ſummon 


. Anſaldo, has knowledge of him.” 


“Pardon me, I do not forget,” re- 


plied Vivaldi; © and I requeſt it may be 


14 remem- 


( 200 ) 


remembered that I am not acquainted 
with that perſon. If, therefore, he had 
given me any account of Anſaldo, I could 
not have relied upon its authenticity,” 
Vivaldi again required of the tribunal to 
underſtand that he did not ſummon An- 
ſaldo, or any other perſon, before them, 
but had merely obeyed their command, to 
repeat what the ſtranger had ſaid. 

The tribunal acknowledged the juſineſs 
of this injunction, and exculpated him from 


any harm that ſhould be the conſequence 


of the ſummons. But this aſſurance of ſafety 


for himſelf was not ſufficient to appeaſe 


Vivaldi, who was alarmed leſt he ſhould 


be the means of bringing an innocent 


perſon under ſuſpicion. The grand in- 
quiſitor again addreſſed him, after a gene- 
ral ſilence had been commanded in the 
court. | 

*« The account you have given of your 
informer,” ſaid he, is ſo extraordinary, 
that it would not deſerve credit, but that 
you 


© ) 

F you have diſcovered the utmoſt reluctance 
to reveal the charges he gave you, from 
which, it appears, that, on your part, at 
kaſt, the ſummons is not malicious. But 
are you certain that you have not deluded 
yourſelf, and that the voice beſide you was 
not an imaginary one, conjured up by your 
agitated ſpirits ?” 

«I am certain,” replied Vivaldi, with 
firmneſs. 

« It is true,” reſumed the grand inqui- 
fitor, © that ſeveral perſons were near you, 
when you exclaimed, that you heard the 
voice of your informer; yet no perſons 
heard it beſides yourſelf!“ 

Where are thoſe peſons now?“ de- 
manded Vivaldi. 

„They are diſperſed; alarmed at your 
accuſation.“ | 

H you will ſummon them,“ ſaid Vi- 
valdi, “and order that my eyes may be 
uncovered, I will point out to you, with- 
out heſitation, the perſon of my informer,. 
mould he remain among them.“ 


15 The 


(202) 


The tribunal commanded that they 
ſhould appear, but new difficulties aroſe. 
It was not remembered of whom the 
crowd conſiſted; a few individuals only 
were recollected, and theſe were ſum- 
moned. 

Vivaldi, in ſolemn expectation, heard 
ſteps and the hum of voices gathering 
round him, and impatiently awaited for 
the words that would reſtore him to fight, 
and, perhaps, releaſe him from uncer- 
tainty. In a few moments, he heard the 
command given; the veil was once more 
removed from his eyes, and he was or- 
dered to point out the accuſer. Vivaldi 
threw an hafty glance upon the ſurround- 
ing ſtrangers. 


The lights burn dimly,” ſaid he, “ 


cannot diſtinguiſh theſe faces,” 

It was ordered that a lamp ſhould be 
towered from the roof, and that the 
ſtrangers ſhould arrange themſelves on ei- 


ther fide of Vivaldi. When this was done,

and he glanced his eyes again upon the

« not one of theſe countenances reſem- 
bles the monk of Paluzzi. Yet, ſtay; 
who is he that ſtands in the ſhade behind 
thoſe perſons on the left? Bid him lift 


his cowl !”? 


The crowd fell back, and the perſon, to 


whom Vivaldi had pointed, was left alone 
within the circle. 


« He is an officer of the Inquiſition,” 


© faid a man near Vivaldi, © and he may 


not be compelled to difcover his face, un-

There was a pauſe of filence in the 
court, except that a dull murmur ran 
through the tribunal, Meanwhile, the 
figure within the circle ſtood motionleſs, 
and remained veiled. 

Spare him,” ſaid the man, who had 
before addreſſed Vivaldi; © he has rea- 
ſons for wiſhing to remain unknown, 
which you cannot conjecture. He is an 
officer of the Inquiſition, and not the 
perſon you apprehend.” 

% Perhaps I can conjecture his rea- 
ſons,” replied Vivaldi, who, raiſing his 
voice, added, “ I appeal to this tribunal, 
and command you, who ſtand alone 
within the circle, you in black garments, 
to unveil your features !” 

Immediately a loud voice iſſued from 
the tribunal, and ſaid, 

« We command you, in the name ; of

felt !”?

preſuming to heſitate, uplifed his cowl. 
Vivaldi's eyes were eagerly fixed upon 
him; but the action diſcloſed, not the 
countenance of the monk! but of an 
official whom he recollected to have ſeen 
once before, though exactly on what occa- 
fion he did not now remember. 

This is not my informer!” faid Vi- 
valdi, turning from him with deep diſap- 
pointment, while the ſtranger dropped his 
cowl, and the crowd cloſed upon him. 
At the aſſertion of Vivaldi, the members 
of the tribunal looked upon each other 
doubtingly, and were ſilent, till the grand 
inquiſitor, waving his hand, as if to com- 
mand attention, addreſſed Vivaldi. 

„It appears, then, that you have for- 
merly ſeen the face of your informer!” 

„ I have already declared ſo,” replied 
Vivaldi. 

The grand inquiſitor demanded when, 


and where, he had ſeen it.

« We muſt inquire farther into this,” 
faid another inquiſitor. Here is ſome 
deception. If yon, Vincentio di Vivaldi, 
have aſſerted a falſchood—tremble !” 

Whether Vivaldi's memory ſtill v:- 
brated with the voice of the monk, or 
that the tone in which this ſame word 
was now pronounced did reſemble it, he 
almoſt ſtarted, when the inquiſitor had 
ſaid tremble! and he demanded who ſpoke

After a fhort converfation among the 
members of the tribunal, the grand inqui- 
ſitor gave orders that the centinels, who 
had watched on the preceding night at 
the priſon door of Vivaldi, ſhould be 
brought into the hall of juſtice. The 
perſons, who had been lately ſummoned 
into the chamber, were now bidden to 
withdraw, and all further examination 
was ſuſpended till the arrival of the centi- 
nels; Vivaldi heard only the low voices 
of the inquifitors, as they converſed pri- 
vately together, and he remained filent, 
thoughtful, and amazed. 

When the centinels appeared, and 
were aſked who+had entered the priſon of

did not contribute to diſſipate thoſe, which 


had prevailed over the oppoſite ſide o 


the queſtion, On the contrary, the ſuf. 


picions of the tribunal, augmenting with 
their perplexity, ſeemed to fluctuaic MW 
equally over every point of the ſubject 
before them, til}, inſtead of throwins | 
any light upon the truth, they only ſerved 
to involve the whole in deeper obſcurity. 
More doubtful than before of the honeſty 
of Vivaldi's extraordinary aſſertions, the 
grand inquifitor informed him, that if, 
after further inquiry into this affair, it 


ſhould appear: he had been trifling with 


the 


( 209 ) 


the credulity of his judges, he would be 
; : ſeverely puniſhed for his audacity ; but 
that, on the other hand, ſhould there 
be reaſon to believe that the centinels 
had failed in their duty, and that ſome 


perſon had entered his priſon, during the 


night, the tribunal would proceed in a 
different manner. 


Vivaldi, perceiving that, to be believed, 
it was neceſſary he ſhould be more cir- 


| cumſtantial, deſcribed, with exactneſs, 
the perſon and appearance of the monk, 
without, however, mentioning the po- 


niard which had been exhibited. A pro- 


found filence reigned in the chamber, 
while he ſpoke; it ſeemed a ſilence not 
merely of attention, but of aſtoniſhment. 
Vivaldi himſelf was awed, and when he 
had concluded, almoſt expected to hear 
the voice of the monk uttering defiance» 


or threatening vengeance; but all re- 


mained huſhed, till the inquiſitor, who. 
had firſt examined him, faid, in a ſolemn

Vivaldi was immediately led from the

ducted to the priſon to which he had ſup-

drawn, he perceived that his guard was 
changed. 


Again left to the filence of his cell, 


he reviewed all that had paſſed in 
the chamber of juſtice; the queſtions 
which had been put to him; the different 
manners of the inquiſitors; the occur-

the latter pronounced the word tremble; 
but the conſideration of all theſe circum- 
ſtances did not in any degree relieve him 
from his perplexity. Sometimes he was 


inclined to think that the monk was an 


inquiſitor, and the voice had more than 


once appeared to proceed from the tribu- 


nal; but he remembered, alſo, that, 


more than once, it had ſpoken cloſe to 


his ear, and he knew that a member of 
this tribunal might not leave his ſtation 


during the examination of a priſoner, 


and that, even if he had dared to do ſo, 
his fingular dreſs would have pointed 
him out to notice, and conſequently to

had exclaimed that he heard the voice of

ployed to throw an impenetrable ſhroud 
over the priſoners of this dreadful tribu-

knowledge of their friends. Such prema- 
ture diſcovery of Vivaldrs circumſtances,

a diſcovery of the perſecutor, and draw 
down upon himſelf the abhorrence and 


the vengeance of a family, whom it was 


now, more than ever, his wiſh and his

tention, that the nuptials of Vivaldi and 
Ellena ſhould be - privately ſolemnized 
immediately on the releaſe of the priſoner, 
who, even if he had reaſon to ſuſpect 
Schedoni for his late perſecutor, would

How little did Vivaldi foreſee, that 
in repeating to the tribunal the ſtran- 
ger's ſummons of father Schedoni, he 
was deferring, or, perhaps, wholly pre- 
venting his own marriage with Ellena 
di Roſalba! How little, alſo, did he 
apprehend what would be the further 
conſequences of a diſcloſure, which the 
peculiar circumſtances of his fituation 
had hardly permitted hin to withhold, 
though, could he have underſtood the 
probable event of it, he would have 
braved all the terrors of the tribunal, and 
= death itſelf, rather than incur the remorſe 
| of having promoted it. 

| The motive for his arreſtation was con- 
cealed from Schedoni, who had not the re- 
moteſt ſuſpicion of its nature, but attributed 
the arreſt to a diſcovery which the tribunal 
had made of his being the accuſer of 
Vivaldi. This diſcloſure he judged to be 
the conſequence of his own imprudence, in 
having ſtated, as an inſtance of Vivaldi's '

contempt for the Catholic faith, that he 
had inſulted a prieſt while doing penance 
in the church of the Spirito Santo. But 
by what art the tribunal had diſcovered 
that he was the prieſt alluded to, and the 
author of the accuſation, Schedoni could 
by no means conjecture, He was willing 
to believe that this arreſt was only for the 
purpoſe of obtaining proof of Vivaldi's 
guilt; and the Confeffor knew that he 
could ſo conduct himſelf in evidence, as 
in all probability to exculpate the priſoner, 
from whom, when he ſhould explain him- 
ſelf, no reſentment on account of his for- 
mer conduct was to be apprehended. Yet 
Schedoni was not perfectly at caſe; for it 
was poſſible that a knowledge of Vivaldi's 
fituation, and of the author of it, had 
reached his family, and had produced his 
own arreſt, On this head, however, his 
fears were not powerful; ſince, the longer 
he dwelt upon the ſubject, the more impro- 
bable it appeared that ſueh a diſcloſure,

have been affected. 1 

Vivaldi, from the night of his late exa- 
mination, was not called upon, till Sche- 
doni and father Anſaldo appeared together 
in the hall of the tribunal. The two 
latter had already been ſeparately exa- 
mined, and Anſaldo had privately ſtated 
the particulars of the confeſſion he had 
received on the vigil of San Marco, 
in the year 1752, for which diſcloſure he 
had received formal abſolution. What 
had paſſed at that examination does not 
© appear, but on this his ſecond interroga-

Penitents, and preſiding over the convent 


of the Santa Maria del Pianto at Naples, d 


is known to you. 


_ To this requiſition Schedoni replied | 


with firmneſs in the negative. 


* You have never, to your knowledge, 
ſeen him before this hour?“ 


&amp;© Never!“ ſaid Schedoni. 


« Let the oath be adminiſtered,” added | 


the grand-vicar. Schedoni having ac- 
cepted it; the ſame queſtions were put to 
Anſaldo concerning the Confeflor, when, 
to the aſtoniſhment of Vivaldi and of the 


reater part of the court, the penitentiary i : 


denied all knowledge of Schedoni. His 
negative was given, however, in a leſs 
deciſive manner than that of the Confeſſor, 
and when the uſual oath was offered, 
Anſaldo declined to accept it. 

Vivaldi was next called upon to identify 
Schedoni : he declared, that the perſon 


85 Fo was: then . out to him, he had 


never 


(6 221) 


ncver known by any other denomination 


man that of father Schedoni; and that he 


: had always underſtood him to be a monk 


F of the Spirito Santo; but Vivaldi was at 
the ſame time careful to repeat, that he 


knew nothing further relative to his life. 
Schedoni was ſomewhat ſurprized at 


4 this apparent candour of Vivaldi towards 

© himſelf ;” but accuſtomed to impute an evil 
motive to all conduct, which he could not 
clearly comprehend, he did not ſcruple to 
believe, 
directed againſt him in this ſeemingly 


that ſome latent miſchief was

After ſome further preliminary forms

the particulars of the confeſſion, which 
had been made to him on the eve of 
San Marco. It muſt be remembered, 
that this was ſtill what is called in the 
Inquiſition, a private examination. 

After he had taken the cuſtomary oaths

truth of what had paſſed before him, An- 
taldo's depofitions were written down 
nearly in the following words ; to which 
Vivaldi liſtened with almoſt trembling at- 
tention, for, beſides the curiofity which 
ſome previous circumſtances had excited 
reſpeQing them, he believed that his own 
fate in a great meaſure depended upon a 
diſcovery of the fact to which they led. 
What, if he had ſurmiſed how much! and 
that the perſon, whom he had been in 
ſome degree inſtrumental in citing before 
this tremendous tribunal, was the father of 
his Ellena di Rofalba ! 

Anſaldo, having again anſwered to his 
name and titles, gave his depoſition as 
follows : 

It was on the eve of the twenty- 
fiſth of April, and in the year 1752, that 
as I fat, according to my cuſtom, in the 
confeſſional of San Marco, 1 was alarmed 
by deep groans, which came from the box. 
on my left hand.“ a 

Vivaldi 


as 
Vivaldi obferved, that the date now 


3 the ſtranger, and he was thus prepared to 
| believe what might follow, and to give 
his confidence to this extraordinary and 
© unſeen perſonage. 

EF Anfaldo continued, © I was the more 


© alarmed by theſe ſounds, becauſe I had 
not been prepared for them; I knew not 


. that any perſon was in the confeſſional, 
nor had even obſerved any one paſs along 
the aifle—but the duſkineſs of the hour 


= ſo; it was aſter ſun-ſet, and the tapers at 
= the ſhrine of San Antonio as yet burned 
&amp; fcebly in the twilight.” 

= © Be brief, holy father,” faid the in- 
E quifitor who had formerly been moſt ac- 
tire in examining Vivaldi; © ſpeak cloſely 
© to the point.”

in agony, ſtruggling with the conſciouſnet; 
of guilt, yet wanting reſolution to confeſs 
it. I tried to encourage the penitent, and 
held forth every hope of mercy and for. 
giveneſs which my duty would allow, 
but for a conſiderable time without effect; 
—the enormity of the fin ſeemed too big 
for utterance, yet the penitent appearcd 
equally unable to endure the concealment 
of it. His heart was burſting with the 
ſecret, and required the comfort of ab- 
ſolution, even at the price of the ſevereſt 
penance.”

Anſaldo, and bowed his head, the men-

rage the penitent, and aſſured him, that

1 cere repentance, he more than once began 
@ his confeſſion, and abruptly dropt it. 
once, indeed, he quitted the confeſſional ; 
his agitated ſpirit required liberty; and it; 
was then, as he walked with perturbed: 
1 ſteps along the aiſle, that I firſt obſerved 
his figure. He was in the habit of a white 
friar, and, as, nearly as I can recollect, 
was about the. ſtature of him, the father 
Schedoni, who now ſtands before me.“ 
As Anſaldo delivered theſe words, the 
attention of the whole tribunal was turned, 
upon Schedoni, who ſtood unmoved, and 
with his eyes bent towards the ground. 
His face,” continued the penitentiary, 
I did not ſee; he was, with good reaſon, 
careful to conceal it; other reſemblance, 
therefore, than the ſtature, I cannot 
point out between them. The voice, in- 
deed; the voice of the penitent, I think I 
ſhall never forget ; I ſhould know it again 
at any diſtance of time.”

of the tribunal. 

„Of that hereafter,” otifaived ths | m- 
22 e ng WORE from Qs point, 
be e iet avearkeld, that the 
circumſtances juſt related were important, 
and ought not to be paſſed over as irrelc- 

t. The mquifitor ſubmitted to this 
opinion, but objected that they were not 
pertinent to the moment; and Anſaldo 
was again bidden to 1 what he had 
heard at conſeffion. 

When the ſtranger returned to the 
ſteps of the confeffional, he had acquired 
ſafficient reſolution to go through with the 


| taſk he had impoſed upon himſelf, and 


à thrilling voice ſpoke throtigh the grate

what he had begun. During this pauſe 
the filence of expectation rapt the court, 
and the eyes of the tribunal were directed 
alternately to Anſaldo and Schedoni, who 
certainly required ſomething more than 
human firmneſs to ſupport unmoved the 
ſevere ſcrutiny, and the yet ſeverer ſuſpi · 
cions, to which he ſtood expoſed. Whe- 
ther, however, it was the fortitude of 


conſcious innocence, or the hardihood of 


atrocious vice, that protected the Confeſſor, 


| he certainly did not betray any emotion. 
„Vivaldi, who had unceafingly obſerved 
him from the commencement of the de- 


poſitions, felt inclined: to believe that he 
was not the pemitent defcribed. Anſaldo, 


having, at length, recollected himſelf, 


proceeded as follows:

ſented his conduct, I know not, but ſhe 
roſe immediately from her chair. - I. did 
not pauſe to. queſtion her motive ; but, 
ſeizing my ſtiletto, I ruſhed into the 
room, with an intent to ſtrike it to the vil- 
lain's heart. The ſuppoſed aſſaſſin of my 
honour eſcaped into the garden, and was 
heard of no more. But your wife ? ſaid 
I. Her boſom received the poniard !' 
replied the penitent.“ 
Anſaldo's voice faltered, as he repeat- 
ed this part of the confeſſion, and he was 
utterly unable to proceed. The tribunal, 
obſerving his condition, allowed him a 
chair, and, after a ſtruggle of ſome mo- 
ments, he added, Think, holy fathers, 
O think ! what. muſt have been my feel- 
ings at that inſtant! I was myſelf the 
lover of the woman, whom he confeſſed 
Himſelf to have murdered.” 
1 Was ſhe innocent?” ſaid a voice; 
and Vivaldi, whoſe attention had latterly 
OLD been 


() 


been fixed upon Anſaldo, now, on look- 
ing at Schedoni, perceived that it was he 
who had ſpoken. At the ſound of his 
voice, the penitentiary turned inſtantly. 
towards him. There was a pauſe of ge- 
neral ſilence, during which Anſaldo's eyes 
were earneſtly fixed upon the accuſed. 
At length, he ſpoke, “She was inno- 
cent!“ he replied, with ſolemn empha- 
fis, © She was moſt virtuous !” | 
Schedoni had ſhrunk back within him- 
ſelf; he aſked no farther. A murmur 
ran through the tribunal, which roſe by 
degrees, till it broke forth into audible- 
converſation ; at length, the ſecretary was 
directed to note the queſtion of Sche- 
doni. 1 | 
Was that the voice of the penitent, 
which you have juſt heard?“ demanded. 
the inquiſitor of Anſaldo. Remember, 
you have ſaid that you ſhould know it 
again !“ 1 15 ;

have acknowledged crimes of ſuch mag-

his truſt to the accuſer, that he did not 


even know him. Vivaldi was no leſs 
perplexed as to what would be the nature 


of the teſtimony, with which the accuſer 


deſigned to ſupport his charges: but the 
pauſe of general amazement, which had 
permitted Vivaldi theſe confiderations, 
was now at an end; the tribunal reſumed 
the examination, and the grand inquiſitor 
called aloud, 

© You, Vincentio di Vivaldi, anſwer 
with exactneſs to the queſtions, that ſhall

He was then atked, ſome queſtions re- 
lative to the perſon, who had viſited him 
in priſon. In his anſwers, Vivaldi was 
clear and conciſe, conſtantly affirming 
that the ſtranger was the ſame, who gow 
accuſed Schedon1. 12 8

elt was,” replied the monk, * that a 
murderer might be brought to juſlice.” 
„This,“ obſerved the grand inquiſitor, 
© might have been accompliſhed by fair 
and open accuſation. If you had known 
the charge to be juſt, it is probable that 
you would have appealed directly to this 
tribunal, inſtead of endeavouring inſidi- 
oully to obtain an influence over the mind 
of a priſoner, and urging him to become 
the inſtrument of bringing the accuſed to 
puniſhment.“ 

« Yet I have not ſhrunk from diſco- 
very,” obſerved the ftranger, calmly; 
« I have voluntarily appeared.” 

At theſe words Schedoni ſeemed again 
much agitated, and even drew his hood 
over his eyes. 

*« That is juſt,” ſaid the grand inquiſi- 
tor, addreffing the ſtranger: © but you 
have neither declared your name, nor 
whence you come ! 

To this remark the monk made no re- 
ply ; but Schedoni, with reviving ſpirit, 

37-08 urged 


\

urged the circumſtance, in evidence of tlie 
malignity and falſchood of the accuſer. 

% Wilt thou compel me to reveal my 
proof ?” ſaid the ſtranger : © Dareſt thou 
to do ſo!” 

« Why ſhould I fear thee ?” anſwered 
Schedoni. 

« Aſk thy conſcience !” ſaid the ſtran - 
ger, with a terrible frown. | 

The tribunal again ſuſpended the exa- 
mination, and conſulted in private toge- 
ther, 

To the laſt exhortation of the monk, 
Schedoni was filent. Vivaldi obſerved, 
that, during this ſhort dialogue, the Con- 
feſſor had never once turned his eyes to- 
wards the ſtranger, but apparently avoid- 
ed him as an object too affecting to be 
looked upon. He judged, from this cir- 
cumſtance, and from ſome other appear- 
ances in his conduct, that Schedoni was 
guilty; yet the conſciouſneſs of guilt 
alone did not perfectly account, he

thought, for the ſtrong emotions with 
which he avoided the fight of his accu 
ſer—unleſs, indeed, he knew that accuſer 
to have been, not only an accomplice in 
his crime, but the actual aſſaſſin. In this 
caſe 1t appeared natural even for the 
ſtern and ſubtle Schedoni to betray his 
horror on beholding the perſon of the 
murderer, with the very inſtrument of 
crime in his graſp. On the other hand, 
Vivaldi could not but perceive it to be 
highly improbable, that the very man 
who had really committed the deed ſhould 
eome voluntarily into a court of juſtice 
for the purpoſe of accufing his employer; 
that he ſhould dare publicly to accuſe him, 
whoſe guilt, however enormous, was not 
more ſo than his own. 

The extraordinary manner alſo, in 
which the accuſer had proceeded in the 
commencement of the affair, engaged Vi- 
valdi's conſideration ; his apparent reluc- 

tance

tance to be ſeen in this proceſs, and the 
artful and myſterious plan, by which he 


had cauſed Schedoni to be ſummoned be- 


fore the tribunal, and had endeavourcd 
that he ſhould be there accuſed by An- 
ſaldo, indicated, at leaſt to Vivaldi's ap- 
prehenſion, the ſearſulneſs of guilt, and, 
ſtill more, that malice, and a tinrſt of 
vengeance, had inſtigated his conduct in 
the proſecution. If the ſtranger had been 
actuated only by a love of juſtice, it ap- 
peared that he would not have proceeded 
towards it in a way thus dark and circui- 
tous, but have ſought it by the uſual pro- 
ceſs, and have produced the proofs, which 


he even now aſſerted he poſſeſſed, of 
Schedoni's crimes. In addition to the 


circumſtances, which ſeemed to ſtrengthen 
a ſuppoſition of the guiltleſsneſs of Sche- 
doni, was that of the accuſer's avoiding 
to acknowledge who he was, and whence 
he came. But Vivaldi pauſed again upon

and he could not imagine why the accuſer 
had adopted a ſtyle of ſecrecy, which, if 
he perſiſted in it, muſt probably defeat 
the very purpoſe of the accuſation ; for 
Vivaldi did not believe that the tribunal 
would condemn a priſoner upon the teſti- 
mony of a perſon, who, when called upon, 
ſhould publicly refuſe to reveal himſelf 
even to them. Yet the accufer muſt cer- 
tainly have confidered this circumſtance 
before he ventured into court; notwith- 
ſtanding which, he had appeared 

Theſe reflections led Vivaldi to various 
conjectures relative to the viſit he had 
himſelf reccived from the monk, the 
dream that had preceded it, the extraor- 
dinary means, by which he had obtained 
admittance to the priſon, the declaration 
of the centinels, that not any perſon hat 
pailed the door, and many other unac- 
countable particulars; and, while Vivaldi 
now looked upon the wild phyſiognomy 
of the ſtranger, he almoſt fancied, as he

thing not of this earth.

murdered,” ſaid he, to himſelſ— “ reſt- 
leſs for juſtice, becoming viſible in our 
world But Vivaldi checked the im- 
perfect thought, and, though his imagi- 
nation inclined him to the marvellous, and 
to admit ideas which, filling and expand- 
ing all the faculties of the ſoul, produce 
feelings that partake of the ſublime, ho 
now reſiſted the propenſity, and diſmiſſed, 
as abſurd, a ſuppoſition, which had begun 
to thrill his every nerve with horror. - He 
awaited, however, the reſult of the exa- 
mination, and what might be the further 
conduct of the ſtranger, with intenſe ex- 
pectation. 

When the tribunal had, at length; 
finally determined on the method of their 
proceedings, Schedoni was - firſt called 
upon, and exammed as to his knowledge: 
af the accufer. It was the ſame inquiſi-

will declare that I know this man. Hi

« What is his condition?“ 

. « He is a monk of the Dominican con-

Where have you ſeen him?“ 

In the city of Naples, where he has

was there that we firſt lived together in 
the confidence of friendſhip.” 

« You now perceive how ill placed 
was that confidence,” ſaid the inquiſitor, 
« and repent, no doubt, of your impru-

The wary Schedoni was not entrapped 
by this obſervation. | 

« I muſt lament a diſcovery of ingra-

ſubjects of my confidence were too pure to

“ call upon you, in the name of your 
deceaſcd brother,” ſaid the accuſer, * to 


reveal the cauſe of my enmity !” 

Vivaldi, ſtruck by the tone, in which 
the ſtranger ſpoke. this, turned his eyes 
upon him, but knew not how to interpret 
the emotion viſible on his countenance. 

The inquifitor commanded Schedoni to 
explain himſelf; the latter could not im- 
mediately reply, but, when he recovercd 
a ſelf- command, he added, 

« promiſed this accuſer, this Nicola 
di Zampari, to aſſiſt his preferment with 
what little intereſt I poſſeſſed; it was but 
little. Some. ſucceeding. circumſtances 
encouraged me to believe that I could 
more than fulfil my promiſe. His hopes 
were elevated, and, in the fulneſs of ex- 
pectation, he was diſappointed, for I was 
myſelf deceived by the perſon in whom 
L had truſted.  'To the difappointment ot

Schedoni pauſed, and an air of diſa- 
tisſaction and anxiety appeared upon his 


features. His accuſer remained filent, 


but a malicious ſmile announced his 
triumph. | 

« You muſt declare alſo the ſervices, 
ſaid the inquiſitor, © which merited the 
reward promiſed.” 

T Thoſe ſervices were ineſtimable to 
me,“ reſumed Schedoni, after a momen- 
tary heſitation; “though they coſt di 
Zampari little: they were the confolations 
of ſympathy, the intelligence of friendfhip, 


which he adminſtered, and which grati- 


tude told me never could be repaid. 

«© Of ſympathy! of friendſhip !” ſaid 
the grand-vicar. Are we to believe 
that a man, who brings falſe accuſation of 
ſo dreadful a nature as the one now be-. 
fore us, is capable of beſtowing the con- 
ſolations of ſympathy and of friendſhip ?

doni, haughtily. 

«© In which inſtance?” aſked the in- 
quiſitor; © for your aſſertions contradict

Schedoni was filent. Vivaldi could not 
judge whether the pride, which occaſioned 
his filence, was that of innocence or- of 
remorſe. 

« It appears, from your own teſti- 
mony,” ſaid the inquiſitor, © that the in- 


gratitude was your's, not your accuſer's, 


fince he conſoled you with kindneſs, 
which you have never returned him !—

Schedoni was ſtill filent.

Schedoni bowed his head. The inqui- 
ſitor then, addreſſing the accuſer, demand-

ſtranger, with malicious triumph; © the

a The rejoinder of the inquiſitor was 
delivered in ſo low a tone, that Vivaldi

would not underſtand it. He was per. 
plexed to interpret the anſwer given to the 
appeal of the ſtranger. He thought that 
the inquiſitor would not have ventured an 
aſſertion thus poſitive, if his opinion had 
been drawn from inference only; and 
that he ſhould know the accuſer, while 
he was conducting himſelf towards him 
as a ſtranger, amazed Vivaldi, no leſs 
than if he had underſtood the character 
of an inquiſitor to be as artleſs as his 
own. On the other hand, he had ſo 
frequently feen the ſtranger at Paluzzi, 
and in the habit of a monk, that he could 
hardly que ſtion the aſſertion of Schedoni, 
as to his identity. 

The inquiſitor, addreſſing Schedoni 
ſaid, © Your evidence we know to be in

here. But, in return for this frank ac-

delivered from the tribunal, Schedoni did 


not deign to reply.

general, „that the accuſer and the ac- 
euſed were once accomplices.“ 
The inquiſitor objected, that this did 
not certainly appear; and that, on the 
contrary, Schedoni ſeemed to have given 
his laſt queſtions in deſpair ; an obſcrva- 
tion which Vivaldi thought extraordinary 
from an inquiſitor. 


„ Be if accomplices, if it fo pleaſe you,” | 


ſaid Schedoni, bowing to the grand vi-

illuſtrious family at Naples, the family of 
the Vivaldi. And there, holy father,” 
added Schedoni, pointing to Vineentio, 
« js the ſon of that ancient houſe, for 
whom J have attempted ſo much!“ 
Vivaldi was almoſt overwhelmed by 
this confeſſion of Schedoni, though he 
had already ſuſpected a part of the truth. 
In the ſtranger he believed he ſaw the 
ſlanderer of Ellena, the baſe inſtrument 
of the Marcheſa's policy, and of Schedo- 


ni's ambition; and the whole of his con- 


duct at Paluzzi, at leaſt, ſeemed now in- 
telligible. In Schedoni he beheld his 
ſecret accuſer, and the inexorable enemy, 
whom he believed to have occaſioned the 
impriſonment of Ellena. At this latter 
conſideration, all circumſpection, all pra- 
dence forſook him: he declared, with 
energy, that, from what Schedoni had 
juſt acknowledged to be his conduct, he 
knew him for his ſecret accufer, and the

accuſer allo of Ellena di Roſalba; au 
he called upon the tribunal to examin; 


into the Conſeſſor's motives for the ae. 1 
cuſation, and aſterwards to give hearig i 
to What he would himſelf unfold, 0 

To this, the grand-vicar replied, u e 
Vivaldi's appeal would be taken into co N 
ſideration; and he then ordered that u 
preſent bafineſs ſhould proceed. .

what he aſſerted to be the dying confeſſun i 


of the aſſaſſin; It was ſigned by a prick 
of Rome, as well as by himſelf, and ay. 
peared from the date to have been giver 
only a very few weeks before. The prieh, 
he ſaid, was living, and might be ſun. 
moned. The tribunal iſſued an order fi 
the apprehenſion of this prieſt, and that 
he ſhould be brought to give evidence on 
the following evening; after which, th: 


buſineſs of this night proceeded, with, 
further interruption, towards its conc!ulivl, W

that Schedoni is the Count di Bruno. The

the Count to have been the inſtigator of 
the murder, but not that Schedoni is the 
Count.“

When on the following day I queſtioned 
Schedoni as to his ſudden departure from

crimes, till the aſſaſſin began his conſeſ- 
ſion, the conoluſion of which clearly ex- 
plained the ſubject of Schedoni's; it ex- 
plained alſo his motive for endeavouring 
ever after to attach me to his intereſt.” 
Mou have now,” ſaid the vicar-general, 
«you have now, confeſſed yourſelf a 
member of the convent of the Spirito 
Santo at Naples, and an intimate of the 
father Schedoni ; one whom for many 
years he had endeavoured to attach'to him. 
Not an hour has paſſed ſince you denied 
all this ; the negative to the latter circum- 
ſtance was given, it is true, by implication 
only; but to the firſt a direct and abſolute 
denial was pronounced!“ 

„ denied that I am a monk of Naples,” 
replied the accuſer, and I appealed to 
the Inquiſitor for the truth of my denial, 
He has ſaid, that J am now a ſervant of 
the moſt holy Inqurſition:” 

The vicar-general, with ſome ſurpriſe, 
looked at the inquiſitor for explanation; 
other 


6269) 


other membeas of the tribunal did the 
ſame ; the reſt appeared to underſtand 
more than they had thought it neceſſary 
to avow, The inquiſitor, who had been 
called upon, roſe, and replied, 

« Nicola di Zampari has ſpoken the 
truth. It is not many weeks fince he 
entered the holy office. A certificate from 
his convent at Naples bears teſtimony to 
the truth of what I advance, and D 
him admittance here.“ 10 

« It is extraordinary that you ſhould 
not have diſcloſed your knowledge of this 
perſon before! ſaid the vicar- general. 

Holy father, I had reaſons,” replied 
the inquiſitor, you will recollect that the 
accuſed was preſent, and you will under- 
ſtand them.” 

« I comprehend you,” faid the vicar: 
general, but 1 do neither approve of, 
nor perceive any neceſſity for your counte- 
nancing the ſubterfuge of this Nicola di 
Zampari, relative to his identity. But 
more of this in private.“ 

« I will 


( 270 ) 

« [ will explain all there, anſwered the 
inquiſitor. 

« It appears then,” reſumed the vicar- 
general, ſpeaking aloud, © that this Nicola 
di Zampari was formerly the friend and 
confident of father Schedoni, whom he 
now accuſes. The accuſation is evidently 
malicious; whether it be alſo falſe, re. 
mains to be decided. A material queſtion 
naturally arifes out of the ſubject - Why 
was not the accuſation brought forward 
befor this period?“ 

The monk's viſage brightened with the 
ſatisfaction of anticipated triumph, and he 
immediately replied, 

_&amp; Moft holy father! as ſoon as I aſcer- 
tained the crime, I prepared to proſecute 
the perpetrator of it. A ſhort period only 
has elapſed fince the aſſaſſin gave his con-

which of theſe was innocent, and had then 
a double motive for cauſing Schedoni to

The queſtion as to the motive for my be- 
coming the enemy of him, who was once 
my friend, is already anſwered ;—it was a 
ſenſe of juſtice, not a ſuggeſtion of malice.” 

The grand-vicar ſmiled, but atked no 
further; and this long examination con- 


cluded with committing Schedoni again 


into cloſe cuſtody, till full evidence ſhould 
be obtained of his guilt, or his innocence 
ſnould appear. Reſpecting the manner of 
his wife's death, there was yet no other evi- 
dence than that which was aſſerted to be 
his own confeſſion, which, though perhaps 
ſufficient to condemn a criminal before the 
tribunal of the Inquiſition, was not enough 
to ſatisfy the preſent vicar-general, who 
gave direction that means might be em- 
ployed towards obtaining proof of cach

Schedoni, when he withdrew from the 
hall, bowed reſpectſully to the tribunal,

ances, he were innocent, or that ſubtlety 
enabled him to reaſſume his uſual addreſs, 
it is certain his manner no longer betrayed

and his air dignified. Vivaldi, who 


during the greater part of this examina-

„ auiſitors wore habits of a faſhion different 
ſrom thoſe which before diſtinguiſhed 
them, end their turbans, of a | ſingular 
erm and larger fze, ſeemed to give an 
| : air of ſterner ferocity to their features. 
The hall, as uſual, was hung with blacks

whether inquiſitor, official, witneſs, or 
priſoner, was habited in the ſame diſmal 
hue, which, together with the kind of 
light diffuſed through the chamber ſrom 
lamps hung high in the vaulted roof, and 
from torches held by parties of officials 
who kept watch at the ſeveral doors, and 
in different parts of this immenſe hall, 
gave a character of gloomy ſoleinnity to 
the aſſembly, which was almoſt horrific. 

Vivaldi was ſituated in a place, whence 
he beheld the whole of the tribunal, and 
could diſtinguiſh whatever was paſling in 
the hall. The countenance of every 
member was now fully diſplayed to him 
by the torchmen, who, arratiged at the 
Keps of the platſorm on which the three 
thief inquiſitors were elevated, extended 


in a ſemicirele on either hand of the place ; 
occupied by the inſerior members. The ” 
glare, which the - torches | threw upon 


the latter, certainly did not ſoften the ex- 
gg of faces, for tho moſt part ſculp- 


2493 5 (IL ' tured, | 


6275) 


tured by paſſions of dark malignity, or 
fiercer cruelty ; ; and Vivaldi could not bear 
even to examine them long. 

Before the bar of the tribunal, he diſ- 
tinguiſhed Schedoni, and little did he ſuſ- 
pect, that in him, a criminal brought thi- 
ther to anſwer for the guilt of murder— 
the murder of a brother, and of a wife, he 


7 beheld the parent of Ellena di Roſalba | 


Near Schedoni was placed the peniten- 


tiary Anſaldo, the Roman prieſt, who was 

5 to be a principal witneſs, and father Nicola 
1 di Zampari, upon whom Vivaldi could not 
eren look without experiencing ſamenrhat 
ol the awe which had prevailed over his 
mind when he was inchned to conſider the 

the ſtranger rather as a viſion of another 
world than as a being of this. The ſame 
wild and (indeſcribable character ſtill dif- 
EZ tinguiſhed his air, his every look and move- 
| : ment, and Vivaldi could not but believe 
that ſomething in the higheſt degree extra- 
E ordinary would yet be difcoy ered concern- 
ing him.

The witneſſes being called over, Vivaldi 
underſtood that he was placed among 
them, though he had only repeated the 
words which father Nicola had ſpoken, 
and which, ſince Nicola himſelf was pre- 
ſent as a witneſs againſt Schedoni, he did 
not perceive could be in the leaſt material 


on the trial. 


When Vivaldi had, in his his 8 
ed to his name, a voice, burſting forth 
from a diſtant part of the hall, exclaimed, 
* It is my maſter ! my dear maſter !” and 
on directing his eyes whence it came, he 
perceived the faithſul Paulo firuggling 
with his guard. Vivaldi called to him to 
be patient, and to forbear reſiſtance, an 


exhortation, however, which ſerved on) 


to increaſe the efforts of the ſervant for 
liberty, and in the next inſtant be broke 
from the graſp of the officials, and, dart We 
ing towards Vivaldi, fell at his feet, ſob- 
bing, and claſping his knees, and exclaim- Wt 
ing, O my maſter my ade | hayel | : 


found you at laſt ?”

Vivaldi, as much affected by this meet- 


7 ing as Paulo, could not immediately ſpeak. 
He would, however, have raiſed and em- 
braced his affectionate ſervant, but Paulo, 


ſtill clinging to his knees and ſobbing, 


BY was ſo much agitated that he ſcarcely un- 
derſtood any thing faid to him, and to the 
; kind aſſurances and gentle remonſtrances 

of Vivaldi, conſtantly replied as if to the 


© officers, whom he 'fancied to be og 
him away. 


© Remember your fituation, Paulo,” 


7 ſaid Vivaldi, © conſider mine wo, and de

« You ſhall not force me hone? ” \ cried 


Paulo, « you can take my life only once; 


if I muſt die, it ſhall be here.” 
« Recollect yourſelf, Paulo, and be 
compoſed. Your life, I truſt, is in n6 


danger.“ 


Paulo looked up, and again burſting 
into a paſſion of tears, repeated, O! my

and ſo believed we ſhould never meet 
again, But now, I ſee you once more, 
and know that you live! O! my maſter! 
my maſter !”* 

The officers who had followed Paulo, 
now endeayouring to withdraw him, he 


became more outrageous. 
„Do your worſt at once,” ſaid he; 
« but you ſhall find tough work of it, if 
you try to force me from hence, ſo you 
had better be contented with killing me 
here.” | 
The incenſed officials were laying vio- 
lent hands upon him, when Vivaldi inter- 
poſed. © I entreat, I ſupplicate you,” 
faid he, that you will ſufler him to re- 
main near me.“

„He knows not what he ſays,” faid 
Vivaldi to the officials, while he endea- 
voured to filence Paulo with his hand,

whatever I ſhall require of him, and will 
be entirely filent ; or, if he does ſpeak

continued Paulo, without noticing Vivaldi,

During the, whole of this harangue, 
Vivaldi, alarmed for the conſequence of 
ſach imprudent, though honeſt indigna- 
tion, had been uſing all poſſible effort to 
ſilence him, and was the more alarmed, 
ſince the officials made no further attempt

Vivaldi attributed to malignity, and to a 
wiſh that Paulo might be entrapped by 
his own act. At length he made himſelf

tribunal with as little ceremony as he had

The buſineſs of the trial ſoon aſter 
commenced. Anfaldo , the penitentiary, 
and father Nicola, appeared as witneſſes, 
as did alſo the Roman prieſt, who had 
aſſiſted in taking the depoſitions of the 
dying aſſaſſin. He had been privately 
interrogated, and had given clear and ſa- 
tisfactory evidence as to the truth of the 
paper produced by Nicola. Other wit- 
neſſes alſo had been ſubpœnaed, whom 
Schedoni had no expectation of meet- 
ing. 

The deportment of the Confeſſor, on 
firſt entering the hall, was collected and 
firm; it remained unchanged when the 
Roman prieſt was brought forward; but, 
on the appearance of another witneſs, 
his courage ſeemed to falter. Before this 
evidence was, however, called for, the 
depoſitions of the aſſaſſin were publicly 
read. They ſtated with the cloſeſt con- 
eiſeneſs the chief facts, of which the 
following is a ſomewhat more dilated 
narrative. 


It 


( 286 ) 


It appeared, that about the year 1742, 
the late Count di Bruno, had paſſed over 
into Greece, a journey which his brother, 
the preſent Confeſſor, having long ex. 
pected, had meditated to take advantage 
of. Though a lawleſs paſſion had firſt 
ſuggeſted to the dark mind of Schedoni 
the atrocious act, which ſhould deſtroy a 
brother, many circumſtances and conlide- 
rations had conſpired to urge him towards 
its accompliſhment... Among theſe was 
the conduct of the late Count towards 
himfelf, which, however reaſonable, as it 
had contradicted his own ſelfiſh gratifica- 
tions, and added ſtrong reproof to op- 
poſition, had excited his moſt inveterate 
hatred. Schedoni, who, as a younger 
brother of his family, bore, at that time, 
the title of Count di Marinella, had diſ- 
ſipated his fmall patrimony at a very carly 
age; but, though ſuffering might then 
have taught him prudence, it had only 


encouraged him in duplicity, and ren 
dered

dered him more eager to ſeek a temporary 
refuge. in the, ſame habits of extravagance 


which had led to it. The Count di Bru- 
vo, though his fortune was very limited, 
had afforded frequent ſupplies to his bro- 
ther; till, finding that he was incorrigi- 
dle, and that the ſums which he himſelf 
ſpared with difficulty from his family were 
} laviſhed, without remorſe, by Marinella, 
inſtead of being applied with economy 


| | 


to his ſupport, he refuſed, further aid than 
was ſufficient for his abſolute. neceſſi- 
ties, 

It would be difficult for a AF mind 
to believe how a conduct ſo reaſonable 
could poſſibly excite hatred in any breaſt, 
or that the power of ſelfiſhneſs could A 
far warp any underſianding as to induce 
Marinella, whom we will in future 


again call Schedoni, to look upon his 
5 brother with deteſtation 6 becauſe he had 
© refuſed to ruin himſelf that his kinſman 


might revel! Yet it is certain that Sche- 


doni,

— 66 


doni, terming the neceſſary prudence of 


bility to the comfort of others, ſuffered 
Full as much reſentment towards him from 


| ſyſtem as he did from paſſion, though 


the meanneſs and the inſenſibility he ima. 
gined in his brother's character were not 
only real traits in his own, but were di. 


Playing themſelves in the very arguments 


he urged againſt them. 

The ranconr thus excited was cheriſhel 
by innumerable circumſtatices, and 11. 
pened by envy, that meaneſt and mo 
malignant of the human paſſions; by 
envy of di Bruno's bleſſings, of an un- 
encumbered eſtate, and of a beautifu! 
wife, he was tempted to perpetrate the 
deed; which might transfer thoſe bleſſings 


to himſelf. Spalatro, whom he employed 


to this purpoſe, was well known to him, 
and he did not fear to confide the conduct 
of the crime to this man, who was to 


pirchats a little habitation on the remote

ſtipend, to refide there. The ruinous 
dwelling, to which Ellena had been car- 
ried, as its ſolitary ſituation ſuited Sche- 
doni's views, was taken for him. | 

Schedoni, who had good intelligence 
of all di Bruno's movements, acquainted 
Spalatro, from time to time, with his ex- 
act ſituation ; and it was after di Bruno, 
on his return, had croſſed the Adriatic, 
from Raguſi to Manfredonia, and was 
entering upon the woods of the Garga- 
nus, that Spalatro, with his comrade, 
overtook him. They fired at the Count 
and his attendants, who were only a 
valet, and a guide of the country; and, 
concealed among the thickets, they ſe- 
curely repeated the attack, The ſhot did 
not immediately ſucceed, and the Count, 
looking round to diſcover his enemy, pre- 
pared to defend himſelf, but the firing was 
ſo rapidly ſuſtained, that, at length, both 
di Bruno and his ſervant fell, covered with 
wounds. The guide fled, 
VOL. III. 5 N The 


( 290) 


The unfortunate travellers were buried 
by their aſſaſſins on the ſpot : but, whe— 
ther the ſuſpicion which attends upon the 
conſciouſneſs -of guilt, prompted Spala- 
tro to guard againſt every poſſibility of 
being betrayed by the accomplice of his 
crime, or whatever was the motive, he 
returned to the foreſt alone ; and, ſhroud- 
ed by night, removed the bodies to a pit, 
which he had prepared under the flooring 
of the houſe where he lived: thus dil- 
placing all proof, ſhould his accomplice 
hereafter point out to juſtice the ſpot in 
which he had aſſiſted to depoſit the man- 
gled remains of di Bruno. 

Schedoni contrived a plauſible hiſtory 
of the ſhipwreck of his brother upon the 
Adriatic, and of the loſs of the whole 
crew; and, as no perſons but the aflaſ- 
fins were acquainted with the real cauſe 
of his death, the guide, who had fled, 
and the people at the only town he had 
paſſed through, fince he landed, being ig-

norant even of the name of di Bruno, 
there was not any circumſtance to contra- 
dict the falſehood. It was univerſally cre- 
dited, and even the widow of the Count 
had, perhaps, never doubted its truth 
or if, after her compelled marriage with 
Schedoni, his conduct did awaken a ſuſ- 
picion, it was too vague to produce any 
ſerious conſequence. 

During the reading of Spalatro's con- 
ſeſſion, and particularly at the concluſion 
of it, the ſurprize and diſmay of Schedonĩ 
were too powerful for concealment ; and 
it was not the leaſt conſiderable part of his 


* wonder, that Spalatro ſhould have come 
to Rome for the purpoſe of making theſe 


depoſitions ; but further conſideration gave 
him a conjecture of the truth. 

The account which Spalatro had given 
of his motive for this journey to the prieſt 


Was, that, having lately underſtood Sche- 
= dont to be refident at Rome, he had fol- 


lowed him thither, with an intention of 
| N 2 re- 


( 292 ) 


relieving his conſcience by an acknowy. 
ledgment of his own crimes, and a dit. 
cloſure of Schedoni's. This, however, 
was not exactly the fact. The deſign of 
Spalatro was to extort money from the 
guilty Confeſſor; a deſign, from which 
the latter believed he had protected him- 
ſelf, as well as from every other evil con- 
ſequence, when he miſled his late ac- 
complice reſpecting his place of reſi- 
dence; little foreſeeing that the very arti- 
fice which ſhould ſend this, man in ſearch 
of him to Rome, inſtead of Naples, would 
be the means of bringing his crimes before 
the public. 

Spalatro had followed the ſteps of Sche - 
doni as far as the town at which he ſlept, 
on the firſt night of his journey; and, 
having there paſſed him, had reached the 
villa di Cambruſca, when, perceiving the 
Confeflor approaching, he had taken 
ſhelter from obſervation, within the ruin. 
The motive, which before made him 

ſhrink 


eG ASL BCD, Cot tio 4 fe + 


neee 


13 293--) 


ſhrink from notice, had contributed, and 
ſtill did fo, to a ſuſpicion that he aimed at 
the life of Schedoni, who, in wounding 
him, believed itz had ſaved himſelf from 
an aſſaſſin. The wonnds, however, of 
Spalatro did not to much difable him, 
but that he procecded towards Rome from 
the town whence the parting road had 
conducted luis maſter to Naples, 

The fatigue of a long journey, per- 
formed chiefly on foot, in Spalatro's 
wounded condition, occaſioned a fever, 
that terminated together his journey and 
his life; and in his laſt hours he had un- 
burdened his conſcience by a full conſei- 
ſion of his guilt. The prieſt, who, on 
this occaſion, had been ſent for, alarmed 
by the importance of the confeſſion, ſince 
it implicated a living perſon, called in a 
friend as witneſs to the depoſitions. This 


witneſs was father Nicola, the former in- 


timate of Schedoni, and who was of a 
character to rejoice in any diſcoyery which 
N 3 might 


( 294) 


might punith a man, from whoſe repeated 
promiſes he had received only ſevere diſ- 
appointments. 

Schedoni now perceived that all his de- 
ſigns againſt Spalatro had failed, and he 
had meditated more than have yet been 
fully diſcloſed. It may be remembered, 
that on parting with the peaſant, his con- 
ductor, the Confeſſor, gave him a ſtiletto 
to defend him, as he ſaid, from the at- 
tack of Spalatro, in caſe of encountering 
him on the road. The point of this in- 
ſtrument was tipped with poiſon; fo 
that a ſcratch from it was ſufficient to in- 
ffict death. Schedoni had for many years 
ſecretly carried about him ſuch an enve- 
nomed inftrument, for reaſons known 
only to himſelf. He had hoped, that, 
ſhould the peaſant meet Spalatro, and be 
provoked to defend himſelf, this ſtiletto 
would terminate the life of his accom- 
plice, -and relieve him from all probabi- 
lity of diſcovery, ſince the other affaiſin

whom he employed had been dead ſeve- 
ral years. The expedient failed in every 
reſpect; the peaſant did not even ſee 
Spalatro; and, before he reached his 
home, he luckily loſt the fatal ſtiletto, 
which, as he had difcovered himſelf to be 
acquainted with ſome circumſtances con- 
nected with the crimes of Schedoni, the 
Confeſſor would have wiſhed him to keep, 
from the chance, that he might ſome time 
injure himſelf in uſing it. "The poniard, 


however, as he had no proper means of 


faſtening it to his dreſs, had fallen, and 


was carried away by the torrent he was 
croſſing at that moment. 


But, if Schedoni had been ſhocked by 


the confeſſion of the aſſaſſin, his diſmay 


was conſiderably greater, when a new 


witneſs was brought forward, and he per- 
ceived an ancient domeſtic of his houſe. 


This man identified Schedoni for Ferando 
Count di Bruno, with whom he had lived 
as a ſervant after the death of the Count 


his brother. And not only did he bear 


N 4 tel- 


( 296) 


teſtimony to the perſon of Schedoni, bot 
to the death of the Counteſs, his wite. 
Giovanni declared himſelf to be one of 
ihe domeſtics who had aſſiſted in convey- 
ing her to her apartment, after ſhe had 
been ſtruck by the poniard of Schedoni, 
and who had afterwards attended her fu» 
neral in the church of the Santa del Mi. 
racoli, a convent near the late reſidence 
of di Bruno. He further affirmed, that 
the phyſicians had reported her death to 
be in conſequence of the wound ſhe had 
received, and he bore witneſs to the flight

diſcovery, and that, of courſe, no further 

ſtep had been taken in the affair. This 
reply appeared to occaſion diſſatisfaction; 

the tribunal was filent, and ſeemed to he- 
ſitate; the vicar- general then addreſſed 

the witneſs- 

* How can you be certain that the per- 
ſon now before you, calling himſelt fa- 
ther Schedoni, is the Count di Bruno,

Giovanni, without hefitation, anſwer- 
ed, that, though years had worn the fea- 
tures of the Count, he recollected them 
the moment he beheld him; and not the 
Count only, but the perſon of the peni- 
tentiary Anſaldo, whom he had ſeen a 
frequent viſitor at the houſe of di Bruno,, 
though his appearance alſo was conſi- 
derably changed by time, and by the cc- 
deſiaſtical habit which he now wore.

The vicar- general ſeemed ſtill to doubt 
the evidence of this man, till Anſaldo 
himſelf, on being called upon, remem- 
bered him to have been a ſervant of the 
Count, though he could not identify the 
Count himſelf. 

The grand-inquifitor remarked, that it 
was extraordinary he ſhould recolle&amp; the 
face of the ſervant, yet forget that of the 
maſter, with whom he had lived in ha- 
bits of intimacy. To this Anfaldo re- 
plied, that the ſtronger paſſions of Sche- 
doni, together with his particular habits 
of life, might reaſonably be ſuppoſed to 
have wrought a greater change upon the 
features of the Count than the character 
and circumſtances of Giovanni's could 
have effected on his. 

Schedoni, not without reaſon, was 
appalled on the appearance of this ſer-

nounced ſentence upon Schedoni, as the 
murderer of the Count his brother; and 
as this, the firſt charge, was ſufficient for 
his condemnation to death, they did not 
proceed upon the ſecond, that which re- 
lated to his wife. 
The emotion betrayed by Schedoni, on 
the appearance of the laſt witneſs, and 
during the delivery of the evidence, difap- 
peared when his fate became certain, 
and when the dreadtul fentence of the 
law was pronounced, it made no viſible 
impreſſion on his mind. From that mo- 
ment, his firmneſs, or his hardihood, never 
forſook him. 
Vivaldi, who witneſſed this condemna- 
tion, appeared infinitely more affected by 
it than himſelf; and, though in revealing 
the circumſtance of father Nicola's ſam- 
mons, which had eventually led to the 
diſcovery of Schedoni's crimes, he had 
not been left a choice in his conduct, he 
felt, at this moment, as miſerable as if 
N 6 he

(300 


he had aQually borne witneſs againſt the 


life of a fellow being : what, then, would 


have been his feelings, had he been told 
that this Schedoni, thus condemned, was 
the father of Ellena di Roſalba! But, 
whatever theſe might be, he was ſoon 
condemned to experience them. One of 
the moſt powerful of Schedoni's paſſions 
appeared even in this laſt ſcene; and as, 
in quitting the tribunal, he paſſed near 
Vivaldi, he uttered theſe few. words— 
In me you have murdered the father ct 
Ellena di Rofalba !” 

Not with any hope that the interceſſion 
of Vivaldi, himſelf alſo a priſoner, could 
in the leaſt mitigate a ſentence pro- 
nounced by the Inquiſition, did he ſay 


this, but for the purpoſe of revenging 


himſelf for the evil, which Vivaldi's evi- | : 


dence had contributed to produce, and 
inflicting the exquiſite miſery ſuch infor- 


mation muſt give, The attempt ſucceeded Þ 8 
too well.

At firſt, indeed, Vivaldi judged this 
to be only the deſperate aſſertion of a 
man, who believed his laſt chance of ef- 
caping the rigour of the law, to reſt with 
him; and, at the mention of Ellena, for- 
getting every precaution, he loudly de- 
manded to know her ſituation. Sche- 
dont, throwing upon him an horrible 
ſmile of triumph and derifion, was pail- 
ing forward without replying, but Vi- 
valdi, unable to ſupport this ſtate of un- 
certainty, aſked permiſſion of the tribu- 
nal to converſe, for a few moments, with 
the priſoner ; a requeſt which was granted 
with extreme reluctance, and only on 
condition that the converſation ſhould he 
public. | 

To Vivaldi's queſtions, as to the ſitua- 
tion of Ellena, Schedoni only replied, 
that ſhe was his daughter, and the ſo- 
lemnity, which accompanied theſe repeated 
aſſertions, though it failed to convince 
Viraldi of this truth, occaſioned him 
| 2g0s 


( 302 ) 

agonizing doubt and apprehenfion : but 
when the Confeffor, perceiving the po- 
licy of diſcloſing her place of reſidence 
to Vivaldi, ſoftened from his defire of 
vengeance to ſecure the intereſt of his 
family, and named the Santa della Pitta as 
her preſent aſylum, the joy of ſuch in- 
telligence overcame, for a time, every 
other conſideration. 

To this dialogue, however, the officials 
put a ſpeedy concluſion; Schedoni was 
led back to his cell, and Vivaldi was ſoon 
aſter ordered to his former cloſe confine- 
ment. 

But Paulo became again outrageous, 
when he was about to be ſeparated from 
his maſter, till the latter, having peti- 
tioned the tribunal, that his ſervant might 
accompany him to his priſon, and received 
an abſolute refuſal, endeavoured to calm 
the violence of his deſpair. He fell at 
his maſter's feet, and ſhed tears, but he 


uttered no further complaints, When he

roſe, he turned his eyes in ſilence upon 
Vivaldi, and they ſeemed to ſay, Dear 
maſter ! I ſhall never ſee you more! and 
with this fad expreſſion, he continued to- 
gaze on him till he had left the hall. 

Vivaldi, notwithſtanding the various- 
ſubjects of his diſtreſs, could not bear to- 
meet the piteous looks of this poor man, 
and he withdrew his eyes; yet, at every 
other ſtep he took, they conſtantly return- 
ed to his faithful ſervant, till the doors 
folded him from fight. 

When he had quitted the hall, Vivaldi 
pleaded, however hopeleſsly, to the offi- 
cials, in favour of Paulo, entreating that 
they would ſpeak to the perſons who kept 
guard over him, and prevail with them to 
ſhew him every allowable indulgence. 

No indulgence can be allowed him,” 
replied one of the men, © except bread. 
and water, and the liberty of walking 1 in. 
his cell.”

None,“ 


(304) 


% None,” repeated the official. This 
priſoner has been near getting one of his 
guards into a ſcrape already, for ſomehow 
or other, he ſo talked him over, and won 
upon him (for he is but a young one here), 
that the man let him have a light, and a 
pen and ink; but, Juckily, it was four 
out before any harm was done.” 

« And what became of this honeſt 
fellow ?” inquired Vivaldi, 

© Honeſt! he was none fo honeſt, 
either, Signor, if he could not mind bis 
duty.“ 

Was he puniſhed, then ?” * 

«© No, Signor, replied the man, 
pauſing, and looking back upon the long 
avenue they were paſſing, to inquire whe- 
ther he was obſerved to hold this conver- 
ſation with a priſoner : „no, Signor, he 
was a younker, ſo they let him off for 
once, and ſent him to guard a man, who 
was not ſo full of his coaxing ways.” 

Paulo

Paulo made him merry, perhaps? 
aſked Vivaldi. What were the coaxing 
ways you ſpoke of?“ 

« Merry, Signor! no! he made him 
cry, and that was as bad.” 

Indeed!“ faid Vivaldi. The man 
muſt have been here, then, a very ſhort 
time.” 

« Not more than a month, or ſo, 
Signor.“ 

« But the coaxing ways you talked 

of,” repeated Vivaldi, “what were they? 
—a ducat, or ſo?” 

© A ducat!” exclaimed the man, “no! 

not a paolo! 


Are you fare of that?” cried vi- 


valdi, ſhrewdly. 


« Aye, ſure enough, Signor. This 
fellow. is not worth a ducat in the 
world?“ 

Rut his maſter is, friend,” obſerved 
Vivaldi, in a very low voice, while he put 
ſome money into his hand. 


The

Vivaldi had given this as a bribe, to 
procure ſome kindneſs for his ſervant, 
not from any conſideration of himſelf, 
for his own critical ſituation had ceaſed at 
this time to be a ſubject of anxiety with 
him. His mind was at preſent ſtrangely 
agitated between emotions the moſt op- 
poſite in their nature, the joy which a 
diſcovery of Ellena's ſafety inſpired, and 
the horrible ſuſpicion that Schedoni's aſ- 
ſurances of relationſhip occaſioned. That 
his Ellena was the daughter of a mur- 
derer, that the father of Ellena ſhould 
be brought to ignominious death, and 
that he himſelf, however unintentionally, 
ſhould have afliſted to this event, were 
confiderations almoſt too horrible to be 
ſuſtained! Vivaldi ſought refuge from 
them in various conjectures as to the mo- 


tive, which might have induced Schedoni 
2 5 to

to aſſert a falſchood in this inſtance; 
but that of revenge alone appeared plau-

Whether he had done fo in his fir{ 
aſſertion was a queſtion, which had raiſed 
in Vivaldi's mind a tempeſt of conjec- 
ture and of horror; for, while the ſub— 
ject of it was too aſtoniſhing to be fully 
believed, it was allo too dreadful, not 
to be apprchended even as a poſſibility,

O holy nun! why bend the mournful head? 
Why fall thoſe tcars from lids uplift in pray'r? 
Why o'er thy pale cheek ſteals the feeble bluſh, 
Then fades, and leaves it wan as the lity 

On which a moon-beam falls ? 


Wu theſe events were paſſing in 
the priſons of the Inquiſition at Rome, 
Ellena, in the ſanctuary of Our Lady of 

Pity, remained ignorant of Schedoni's ar- 

reſt, and of Vivaldi's ſituation, She un- 
derſtood that the Conſeſſor was preparing 
to acknowledge her for his daughter, and 
believed that ſhe comprehended alto the 

motive for his abſence ; but, though he 

*had forbidden her to expect a vilit from 

AP. him till his arrangement ſhould be com-

mean time, and inform her of all the pre-

ſent circumſtances of Vivaldi; his uncx. 
pected ſilence had excited, therefore, ap. 
prehenſions as various, though not ſo ter. 
rible, as thoſe which Vivaldi had ſuffered 
for her; nor did the filence of Vivaldi 
himſelf appear leſs extraordinary. 

« His confinement muſt be ſevere in- 
deed,” ſaid the afflicted Ellena, “ ſince 
he cannot relieve my anxiety by a ſingle 
line of intelligence. Or, perhaps, ha- 
raſſed by unceafing oppoſition, he has 
ſubmitted to the command of his family, 
and has conſented to forget me. Ah! 
why did I leave the opportunity for that 
command to his family ; why did I not en- 
force it myſelf !” 

Yet, while ſhe uttered this ſelf-reproach, 
the tears ſhe ſhed contradicted the pride 


which had ſuggeſted it; and a conviction Þ 
lurking in her heart that Vivaldi could not 
ſo reſign her, ſoon diſſipated thoſe tears. | 
But other conjectures recalled them; it was | 
poſſible that he was ill—-that he was dead.

In ſuch vague and gloomy ſurmiſe her 
days paſſed away; employment could no 
longer withdraw her from herſelf, nor 
muſic, even for a moment, charm away 
the ſenſe of ſorrow. Yet ſhe regularly 
partook of the various occupations of the 
nuns ; and was ſo far from permitting 
herſelf to indulge in any uſeleſs expreſſion 
of anxiety, that the had never once diſ- 


| cloſed the facred ſubject of it; fo that, 
though ſhe could not aſſume an air of 
cheerfulneſs, ſhe never appeared otherwiſe 


7 


than tranquil. Her moſt ſoothing, though 
perhaps moſt melancholy hour, was when 
about ſun-ſet ſhe could withdraw unno- 
ticed, to the terrace among the rocks 
that overlooked the convent, and formed 
a part of its domain. There, alone and 


relieved from all the ceremonial reſtraints 
ol the ſociety, her very thoughts ſeemed 
more at liberty. As, from beneath the 
light foliage of the accacias, or the more 
majeſtic ſhade of the plane: trees that waved 


their

their branches over the many- coloured 
cliffs of this terrace, Ellena looked down 
upon the magnificent feenery of the bay; 
it brought back to memory, in fad yet 
pleaſing detail, the many happy days ſhe 
had paſſed on thoſe blue waters, or on 
the ſhoxes, in the ſociety of Vivaldi ani 
her departed relative Bianchi; and every 
point of the proſpect marked by ſuch re- 
membrance, which the veiling diſtance 
ſtole, was reſcued by affection and pic- 
tured by imagination, in tints more ani- 
mated than thoſe of brighteſt nature. 

One evening Ellena had lingered on 


the terrace later than uſual. - She hal 


watched the rays retiring from the higlieft 


points of the horizon, and the fading ; 
imagery of the lower ſcene, till, the fun Wi 
having ſunk into the waves, all colouring 2 
was withdrawn, except an empurpling 
and repoſing hue, which overſpread th: ö 3 ;

but the ſolemn tint that inveſted them

„lena was unwilling to relinquiſh this in-

court, when ſhe heard approaching ſteps, 
and, on turning into the walk, perceived 
ſeveral perſons advancing in the ſhady 
diſtance. Among the voices, as they drew 
nearer, ſhe diſtinguiſhed one whoſe inte- 
reſting tone engaged all her attention, 
and began allo to awaken memory. She 
liſtened, wondered, doubted, hoped, and

ſhe could not be deceived in thoſe tender 


accents, ſo full of intelligence, ſo expreſſive 
of ſenfibility and refinement. She pro- 
ceeded with quicker ſteps, yet faltered as 
ſhe drew near the group, and pauſed to 
inquire whether among them was any 
figure that might accord with the voice,

The voice ſpoke again; it pronounced 
her name; pronounced it with the trem-

Ellena ſcarcely dared to truſt her ſenſes,

when ſhe beheld Olivia, the nun of San 

Stefano, in the cloiſters of La Pieta ! 
Ellena could find no words to expreſs 
her joy and ſurpriſe on beholding her pre- 
ſerver in ſafety, and in theſe quiet groves; 
but Olivia repaid all the affectionate ca- 
reſſes of her young friend, and, while ſhe 
promiſed to explain the circumſtance that 
had led to her preſent appearance here, 
ſhe, in her turn, made numerous inqui- 
ries relative to Ellena's adventures aſter

now, however, ſurrounded by too many 
auditors to allow of unreſerved converſa- 
tion; Ellena, therefore, led the nun to her 
apartment, and Olivia then explained her 
reaſons for having left the convent of San 
Stefano, which were indeed ſufficient to 
juſtify, even with the moſt rigid devotee, 
her conduct as to the change. This un- 
tortunate recluſe, it appeared, perſecuted 
by the ſuſpicions of the abbeſs, who un-

biſhop of her dioceſe for leave to remove 
to La Pieta. The abbeſs had not proof 
to procced formally againſt her, as an 
accomplice in the eſcape of a novice, for 
though Jeronimo could have ſupplied the 
requiſite evidence, he was too deeply im- 
plicated in this adventure to do ſo with- 
out betraying his own conduct. From 
his having withheld ſuch proof, it appears, 
however, that accident rather than deſign 
Had occaſioned his failure on the evening

But, though the abbeſs had not teſtimony 
enough for legal puniſhment, ſhe was 
acquainted with circumſtances ſufficient 
to juſtify ſuſpicion, and had both the in- 
clination and the power to render Olivia 
very miſerable.

was influenced by many conſiderations,

converſations ſhe had held with Ellena 


reſpecting the ſtate of that ſociety. Her 
deſign ſhe had been unable to diſcloſe 
to her friend, leſt, by a diſcovery of ſuch 
correſpondence, the abbeſs of San Ste-

conſiderable delay and difficulty, arrived, 
and when it came, the jealous anger of 
the ſuperior rendered an immediate depar- 
ture neceſſary.

unhappy in her local circumftances, but 
it is probable ſhe would have. concluded 
her days within the walls of San Stefano,

accomplice in the eſcape of a novice, for 
though Jeronimo could have ſupplied the

But, though the abbeſs had not teflimony 
enough for legal puniſhment, ſhe was 
acquainted with circumſtances ſufficient 
to juſtify ſuſpicion, and had both the in- 
clination and the power to render Olivia 
very miſerable. 

In her choice of La Picta, the nun 
was influenced by many conſiderations, 
ſome of which were the conſequence of

Ellena was particular in her inquiries 
whether any perſon of the monaſtery had 
ſuffered for the aſſiſtance they had given 
her; and Jearning that not one, except 
Olivia, had been even ſuſpected of be- 
'friending her, ſhe underſtood, that the ve. 
nerable friar, who had dared to unfafcn 
the gate which reſtored her with Vivaldi 
to liberty, had not been involved by his 
kindneſs. 

t is an embarraſſing and rather an 
unuſual circumitance,” concluded Olivia, 
to change one's convent ; but you per. 
ceive the ſtrong reaſons which determined 
me upon a removal. I was, however, per. 
haps, the more impatient of ſevere treat- 


ment, ſince you, my fiſter, had deſcribed 


to me the ſociety of Our Lady of Pity, and 
fince I believed it poſſible that you might 
form a part of it. When, on my arrival 
here, I learned that my wiſhes had not 
deceived me on this point, I was impa- 
tient to ſee you once more, and as toon as

the ceremonies attending an introduction 
to the ſuperior were over, I requeſted to 
be conducted to you, and was in ſearch of 
you when we met in the avenue. It is un- 
neceſſary for me to inſiſt upon the ſatis- 
faction which this- meeting gives me ; but 
you may not, perhaps, underſtand how 
much the manners of our lady abbeis, and 
of the ſiſterhood in general, as far as a 
firſt interview will allow me to judge of 
them, have re animated me. The gloom, 
which has long hung over my proſpects, 
ſeems now to open, and a diſtant gleam 
promiſes to light up the evening of my 
ſtormy day.” 

Olivia pauſed and appeared to recollect 
herſelf; this was the firſt time ſhe had 
made fo direct a reference to her own 
misfortunes; and, while Ellena filently 
remarked it, and obſerved the dejection, 
which was already ſtealing upon the ex- 
preſſive countenance of the nun, ſhe 
withed, yet feared to lead her back to- 
wards the ſubject of them.

Endcavouring to diſmiſs force paintu]

languid gaicty, Olivia taid, “ Now that 
J haye related the hiſtory of my removal, 
and ſufficiently indulged my egotiſm, will 
you let me hear what adventures have be- 
fallen you, my young friend, ſince the 
melancholy adieu you gave me in the gat- 
dens of San Stefano.“ 

This was a taſk, to which Ellena's 1:- 
rits, though revived by the preſence of 
Olivia, were ſtill unequal. Over the 
ſcenes of her paſt diſtreſs Time had not yet 
drawn his ſhadowing veil; the colours 
were all too freth and gariſh for the meek 
dejection of her eye, and the ſubject was 
too intimately connected with that of her 
preſent anxicty, to be reviewed without 
very painful teclings. She therefore re- 
queſted Olivia to ſpare her from a 4858

Schedoni, ſhe merely mentioned her ſe- 
paration from Vivaldi upon the banks of 
the Celano, and that a variety of diſtreſſ- 
ing circumſtances had intervened before 
ſhe could regain the ſanctuary of della 
Pieta. 

Olivia underſtood too well the kind of 
feelings, from which Ellena was deſirous 
of eſcaping, willingly to ſubject her to a 
renewal. of them; and felt too much ge- 
nerous compaſſion for her ſufferings not to 
endeavour to ſoothe the ſenſe of them by 
an exertion of thoſe delicate and nameleſs 
arts which, while they mock detection, 
faſcinate the weary ſpirit as by a charm ot 
magic! | | 

The friends continued in converſation, - 
till a chime from a chapel of the convent 
ſummoned them to the laſt veſpers ; and, 
when the ſervice had concluded, they ſe- 
parated for the night. 

With the ſociety of La Pitta, Oli- 
via had thus found an aſylum ſuch 

0:5. as 


( 322 ) 


as till lately ſhe had never dared to 
hope for; but, though ſhe frequently ex- 
preſſed her ſenſe of this bleſſing, it was 
_ ſeldom without tears; and Ellena obſerved, 
with ſome ſurprife and more diſappoint- 
ment, within a very few days after her ar- 
rival, a clond of melancholy ſpreading 
again over her mind. 

But a nearer intereſt ſoon withdrew 
Ellena's attention from Olivia to fix it 
upon Vivaldi; and, when ſhe ſaw her in- 
firm old ſervant, Beatrice, enter a cham- 
ber of the convent, ſhe anticipated that 
the knowledge of ſome extraordinary, and 
probably unhappy, event had brought her. 
She knew too well the circumſpection of 
Schedoni to believe that Beatrice came 
commiſſioned from him; and as the un- 
certain ſituation of Vivaldi was ſo con- 
ſtantly the ſubject of her anxiety, ſhe im- 
. mediately concluded that her ſervant came 
to announce ſome evil relative to him.— 
His indiſpoſition, perhaps his actual con- 

finement

finement in the Inquiſition, which lately 
ſhe had ſometimes been inclined to think 
might not have been a mere menace to 
Vivaldi, though it had proved to be no 
more to herſelf;—or poſſibly the came to 
tell of his death—his death in thoſe pri- 
ſons! This laſt was a poſlibility that al- 
moſt incapacitated her for inquiring what 
was the errand of Beatrice. 

The old ſervant, trembling and wan, 
cither from the fatigue of her walk, or 
from a conſciouſneſs of diſaſtrous intelli- 
rence, ſeated herſelf without ſpeaking, 
and ſome moments elapſed before ſhe 
could be prevailed with to anſwer the re- 
peated inquiries of Ellena. 

O0 Signora!“ ſaid ſhe, at length, 
* you do not know what it is to walk up 
hill ſuch a long way, at my age! Well! 
heaven protect you, I hope you never 
will!“

Ellena; © I am prepared for it, and you 
need not fear to tell me all you know.“

«© Holy San Marco!” exclaimed Bea- 
trice, if death be ill news, you have 
gueſſed right, Signora, for I do bring 
news of that, it is certain. How came 
you, Lady, to know my crrand ? They 
have been beforehand with me, I ſee, 
though I have not walked fo faſt up hill 
this many a day, as I have now, to tel] 
you what has bappened.” 

She ſtopped on obſerving the changing 
countenance of Ellena, who tremulon!!y 
called upon her to explain what had hap- 
pened — who was dead; and entreated 
her to relate the particulars as ſpeedily a. 
poſſible. 

* You ſaid yon was prepared, Sig- 
nora,” faid Beatrice, © but your looks te!

„What is the event you would dit- 
cloſe?” ſaid Ellena, almoſt breathlels. 
When did it happen ?—-be brief.”

ſervant of the Marcheſe's that I had it 
from.“ 

« The Marcheſc's?“ interrupted Ellena 
in a faitering voice. 

e Aye, Lady; you will ſay that is pretty 
good authority.” 

„Death! and in the Marcheſe's ſamily!“ 
exclaimed Ellena. 

*© Yes, Signora, I had it from his own 
ervant. He was paſſing by the garden- 
cate juſt as I happened to be ſpeaking to - 
the maccaroni- man, — But you are ill, 
Lady!“ 

„am very well, if you will put pro- 
cced,“ replied Ellena, faintly, while- her 
eyes were fixed upon Beatrice, as if they 
only had power to enforce her meaning. 

Well, dame, he ſays to me, © I have 
not ſeen you of a long time. —* No,” ſays 
I, © that is a great grievance truly! for 
old women now-a-days are not much 
thought of ; out of fight out of mind with 
them, now-a-days !“ 


„I be-

ce T beſeech you to the purpoſe,” inter- 
rupted Ellena. Whoſe death did he an- 
nounce ?” She had not courage to pro- 
nounce Vivaldi's name. 

« You ſhall hear, Signora. I ſaw he 
looked in a ſort of a buſtle, ſo I aſked him 
how all did at the Palazzo : ſo he anſwers, 
* Bad enough, Signora Beatrice, have not 
you heard ?'— Heard,“ ſays I ; © what 
ſhould I have heard ?'—* Why,“ ſays he, 
* of what has juſt happened in our family,” 

«© O heavens !” exclaimed Elllena, * he 
is dead ! Vivaldi is dead !” | 

« You ſhall hear, Signora, continued 
Beatrice. 

«© Be brief!“ ſaid Ellena, „ anſwer me 
ſimply yes or no.” 

1 cannot, till I come to the right 
place, Signora; if you will but have a 
little patience, you ſhall hear all. But it 
you fluſter me ſo, you will put me quite 
out.” 

Grant me patience !“ ſaid Ellena, en- 


deavouring to calm her ſpirits.

« With that, Signora, I aſked him to 
walk in and reſt himſelf, and tell me 
all about it. He anſwered, he was in 
a great hurry, and could not ſtay a mo- 
ment, and a great deal of that ſort ; but 
I, knowing that whatever happened in 
that family, Signora, was ſomething to 
you, would not let him go oft fo eaſily; 
and ſo, when I aſked him to refreſh him- 
ſelf with a glaſs of lemon-ice, he forgot 
all his buſineſs in a minute, and we had a 
long chat.“ 

And Beatrice might now have conti- 
nued her circumlocution, perhaps as long 
as ſhe had pleaſed, for Ellena had loſt all 
power to urge inquiry, and was ſcarcely 
ſenſible of what was ſaid. She neither 
ſpoke, nor ſhed a tear; the one image 
that poſſeſſed her fancy, the image of 
Vivaldi dead, feemed to hold all her facul- 
ties, as by a ſpell.

about a month ago that the Marcheſa was

had ſeemed poorly a long time, but it was 
from a conver/a2ione at the di Vogho Pa-

indeed. They found out that ſhe bad

though nobody elte had ſuſpected it, and 
the Marcheſa's own phyſician was blamed 
for not finding it out before. But he, 
added the rogue, had a regard for my 
lady. He was very obſtinate, too, for he 
kept ſaying almoſt to the laſt, there was 
no danger, when every body elſe ſaw how 
it was going, The other: doctors ſoon 
made their words good, and my lady 
died.“ | 

&amp; And her ſon” —ſaid Ellena, „was he 
with the Marcheſa when ſhe expired?“ 

«© What, Signor Vivaldi, lady? No, 
the Signor was not there.” 

This is very extraordinary!“ obſerved 
Ellena with emotion. * Did the ſervant 
mention him?“ 

* Yes, Signora ; he faid what a fad 
thing it was that he ſhould be out of the 
Way.

where !” 

Are his family then ignorant where he 
is?” aſked Ellena, with increaſed emotion. 

To be ſure they are, lady, and have 
been for theſe many weeks. They have 
heard nothing at all of the Signor, nor of 
one Paulo Mendrico, his ſervant, thoughthe 
Marcheſe's people have been riding poſt 


after them from one end of the kingdom: 


to the other all the time.” 

Shocked with the conviction of a cir- 
cumſtance, which, till lately, ſhe ſcarcely 
believed was poſſible, the impriſonment 


of Vivaldi in the Inquiſition, Ellena loſt | 


for a while all power of further inquiry ; 
but Beatrice proceeded. 
© The Lady Marcheſa ſeemed to lay 
ſomething much to heart, as the man told 
me, and often inquired for Signor Vin-

to the perſon who, after betraying him into 
the Inquiſition, could yet have ſuffered 
her, though arreſted at the ſame time, to

Les, Signora, for ſhe wanted ſadly to

ſent for her Conſeſſor, one father Schedoni, 
I think they call him, and“ 

« What of him,” ſaid Ellena, incauti- 
ouſly. 

Nothing, Signora, for he could not be 
found.” 

Not be found!“ repeated Ellena. 

“No, Signora, not juſt then; he was 
Confeffor, I warrant, to other people be- 
ſide the Marcheſa, and I dare ſay they had 
ſins enough to confeſs, ſo he could not 
get away in a hurry.” 

Ellena recollected herſelf ſufficiently to 
aſk no further of Schedoni; and, when ſhe 
confidered the probable cauſe of Vivaldi's 
arreft, ſhe was again conſoled by a hope 

that

that he had not fallen into the power of 


real officials, fince the comrades of thc 
men who had arreſted him had proved 
themſelves otherwiſe ; and ſhe thought it 
highly probable, that, while undiſcovered 
by his family, he had been, and was fi!!! 
engaged in ſearching for the place of her 
confinement. 

* But I was ſaying,” proceeded Beatrice, 
« what a buſtle there was when my lady, 
the Marcheſa, was dying. As this father 
Schedoni was not to be found, another 


Confeſſor was ſent for, and ſhut up with 


her for a long while indeed! And then 
my Lord Marcheſe was called in, and 
there fecmed to be a deal going forward, 
for my lord was heard every naw and then 
by the attendants in the antechaniver, 
talking loud, and ſometimes my Lady 
Marchefa's voice was heard too, though 
he was Yo ill! At laſt all was filent, and 


aſter ſome time my Lord came out of the 


room, and he ſcemed very much fluſtered, 
they

they ſay, that is, very angry and yet very 
ſorrowful. But the Confeſſor remained 
with my Lady for a long while after; and, 
when he departed, my Lady appeared 
more unhappy than ever. She lived all 
that night and part of the next day, and 
ſomething ſeemed to he very heavy at her 
heart, for ſhe ſometimes wept, but oftener 
groaned, and would look fo, that it was 
piteous to ſee her, She frequently aſked 
for the Marcheſe, and when he came, the 
attendants were ſent away, and they held 
long conferences by themſelves. The Con- 
ſeſſor alſo was ſent for again, juſt at the 
laſt, and they were all ſhut up together. 
After this, my Lady appeared more caſy in 
her mind, and not long after ſhe died.” 
Ellena, who had attended cloſely to 
this little narrative, was prevented for the 
preſent from aſking the few queſtions 
which it had ſuggeſted, by the entrance 


of Olivia, who, on perceiving a ſtranger, 


was retiring, but Ellena, not conſidering

theſe inquiries as important, prevailed with 
the nun to take a chair at the embroidery 
frame ſhe had lately quitted. 

After converſing for a few moments 
with Olivia, ſhe returned to a conſidera- 
tion of her own intereſts. The abſence 
of Schedoni ſtill appeared to her as ſome- 
thing more than accidental ; and, though 
ſhe could not urge any inquiry with Bea- 
trice concerning the monk of the Spirito 
Santo, ſhe ventured to aſk whether ſhe 
had lately ſeen the ſtranger, who had re- 
ſtored her to Altieri, for Beatrice knew 
him only in the character of Ellena's de- 
liverer. 

« No, Signora,“ replied Beatrice rather 
ſharply, „I have never ſeen his face fince MW *

that matter, I did not ſee much of it there; IM * 
and then how he contrived to let himſelt

ſhewn his face to me, for I ſhould only 
have bleſſed him for bringing you ſafe 
home again !” 

Ellena was ſomewhat ſurprized to find 
that Beatrice had noticed a circumſtance 
apparently ſo trivial, and replied, that ſhe 
had herſelf opened the door for her pro- 
tector. 

While Beatrice ſpoke, Olivia raifing 
her eyes from the embroidery, had fixed 
them upon the old ſervant, who reſpect- 
fully withdrew her's ; but, when the nun 
was again engaged on her work, ſhe re- 
fumed her obſervation. Ellena fancied 
ſhe perceived ſomething extraordinary in 
this mutual examination, although the 
curiofity of ſtrangers towards each other 
might have accounted for it. 

Beatrice then received directions from 
Ellena as to fome drawings, which ſhe 
wiſhed to have ſent to the convent, and 
when the ſervant ſpoke in reply, Olivia

While ſhe earneſily regarded Olivia, 
there was an exprefſion of diſmay in her

The nun's complexion varied every inſtant, 
and her words failed when ſhe attempted 
to ſpeak. Beatrice meanwhile exclaimed,

She pointed to Ellena, and the ſentence 
died on her lips. 

Beatrice, wholly occupied by intereſts 
of her own, gave no reply, but exclaimed,

them, and who weeping, trembling, and 
Walmoſt fainting, held her there in filence. 

Ullena, after ſome moments had thus 
paſſed, requeſted an explanation of what

ſhe witneſſed, and Beatrice at the fame 
time demanded the cauſe of all this emo. 
tion. For can it be that you did not 
know one another?“ ſhe added. 

«© What new diſcovery is this?” ſaid 
Ellena, fearfully to the nun. * It is but 
lately that I have found my father! O tel! 
me by what tender name 1 am to call 
you ?” 

„Jour father!“ exclaimed Olivia. 

« Your father, lady!“ echoed Beatrice. 

Ellena, betrayed by ſtrong emotion into 
this premature mention of Schedoni, was 
embarraſſed and remained ſilent. 

« No, my child!“ ſaid Olivia, ſoften- 
ing from amazement into tones of ineffable 
ſorrow, while ſhe again prefled Fllena to 
her heart No!—thy father is in the 
grave!“ 

Ellena no longer returned her careſſes; 
ſurprize and doubt ſuſpended every tender 
emotion; ſhe gazed upon Olivia with an 
intenſeneſs that partook of wildneſs. At

length ſhe ſaid Nlowly—** It is my mother, 
then, whom I fee! When will theſe diſ- 
coveries end! 

| « It is your mother!” replied Olivia 
| folemnly, © a mother's bleſſing reſts with 
you!“ 

The nun endeavoured to ſoothe the 
agitated ſpirits of Ellena, though ſhe was 
herſelf nearly overwhelmed by the various 
and acute feelings this diſcloſure occa- 
gfoned. For a conſiderable time they were 
unable to ſpeak. but in ſhort ſentences of 
affectionate exclamation, but joy was evi- 
dently a more predominant feeling with 
| the parent than with the child. When, 


© however, Ellena could weep, ſhe became 
0 more tranquil, and by degrees was ſen— 
IC fible to a degree of happineſs ſuch as ſhe 

| had perhaps never experienced. 
; WF _1o Meanwhile Beatrice ſeemed loſt in 
r amazement mingled with fear. She ex- 
5 preſſed no pleaſure, notwithſtanding the 


the joy ſhe witneſſed, but was uniformly 
grave and obſcryant. 


P2 Olivia, 


( 340 ) 


Olivia, when ſhe recovered ſome deprec 
of compoſure, inquired for her fiſter 
Bianchi. The filence and ſudden dejec- 
tion of Ellena indicated the truth. On 
this mention of her late miſtrels, Beatrice 
recovered the uſe of ſpeech. 

„Alas! lady,” faid the old ſervant, 
« ſhe is now where I belicyed you were! 
and I ſhould as ſoon have expected to ſee 
my dear miſtreſs here as yourſelf!” 

Olivia, though affected by this intelli- 
gence, did not feel it with the acuteneis 
ſhe would have done probably at any 
other moment. Atter ſhe had indulged 
he tears, ſhe added, that from the unuſual 
filence of Bianchi, ſhe had ſuſpected the 
truth, and particularly fince not any an- 
ſwer had been returned to the letter ſhe 
had ſent to Altieri upon her arrival at the 
Santa della Picta. 

« Alas!” ſaid Beatrice, *I wonder 
much my lady abbeſs failed to tell you 
the ſad news, for ſhe knew it too well !—

My dear miſtreſs is buried in the church 
here! as for the letter, I have brought it 
with me for Signora Ellena to open.” 

« The lady abbeſs is not informed of 
our relationſhip,” replied Olivia. and I 
have particular reaſons for wiſhing that at 
preſent ſhe ſhould remain 1gnorant of it. 
Even you, my Ellena, muſt appear only 
as my friend, till ſome inquiries have been 
made, which are eſſential to my peace.“ 

Olivia aſked an explanation of El- 
lena's late extraordinary aflertion reſpect- 
ing her father, but this was a requeſt 
made with emotions very different from 
thoſe which hope or joy inſpire. Ellena, be- 
lieving that the ſame circumſtances which 
had deceived herſelf during ſo many years, 
as to his death, had alſo miſled Olivia, 
was not ſurpriſed at the incredulity her 
mother had ſhewn, but ſhe was conſide- 
rably embarraſſed how to anſwer her in- 
quiries. It was now too late to obſerve 
the promiſe of ſecrecy extorted from her 


P 3 by 


„„ 


by Schedoni; the firſt moments of ſur— 
prize had betrayed her; yet, while ſhe 
trembled further to tranſgreſs his injunc- 
tion, ſhe perceived that a full explanation 
was now unavoidable, And, ſince Ellena 
conſidered, that as Schedoni could not 
have foreſeen her preſent peculiar fitua- 
tion, his command had no reference to 
her mother, her ſcruples on this head dit- 
appeared. When, therefore, Beatrice had 
withdrawn, Ellena repeated her aflertion, 
that her father ſtill lived; which, though 
it increaſed the amazement of Olivia, did 
not vanquiſh her incredulity. Olivia 
tears flowed faft, while in contradiction to 
this aſſurance, ſhe mentioned the year in 
which the Count di- Bruno died, with 
ſome circumſtances relative to his death; 
which, however, as Ellena underſtood 
that her mother had not witneſſed it, ſhe 
ſtill believed had not happened. To 
confirm her late affertion, Ellena then 
related a few particulars df her ſecond 
interview

interview with Schedoni, and, as ſome 
confirmation that he lived, offered to 
produce the portrait, which he had claimed 
as his own. Olivia, in great agitation, 
requeſted to ſee the miniature, and Ellena 
left the apartment in ſearch of it. 

Every moment of her abſence was to 
Olivia's expectation lengthened to an 
hour; ſhe paced the room; liſtened for a 
footſtep; endeavoured to tranquilize her 
ſpirits, and ſtill Ellena did not return. 
Some ſtrange myſtery ſeemed to lurk in 
the narrative ſhe had juſt heard, which 
ſhe wiſhed, yet dreaded to develope; and 
when, at length, Ellena appeared with 
the miniature, ſhe took it in trembling 
eagerneſs, and having gazed upon it for 
an inſtant, her complexion faded, and ſhe 
fainted. 

Ellena had now no doubt reſpecting the 
truth of Schedoni's declaration, and blam- 
ed herſelf for not having more gradually 
ne her mother for the knowledge of 
P 4 a cir- 


 { 844 


a circumſtance, which ſhe believed had 
. overwhelmed her with joy. The uſual 
applications, however, ſoon reſtored Oli— 
via, who, when ſhe was again alone with 
her daughter, defired to behold once more 
the portrait. Ellena, attributing the ſtrong 
emotion, with which ſhe ſtill regarded it, 
to ſurprize, and fear leſt ſhe was admitting 
a fallacious hope, endeavoured to comfort 
her by renewed aſſurances, that not only 
the Count di Bruno yet exiſted, but that 
he lived at this very time in Naples, 
and further, that he would probably be in 
her preſence within the hour; When ! 
quitted the room for the miniature,” added 
Ellena, * I difpatched a perſon with a 
note, requeſting to ſee my father imme- 
diately, being impatient to realize the joy, 
which ſuch a meeting between my long 
loſt parents muſt occaſion.” 

In this inſtance Ellena had certainly 
ſuffered her generous ſympathy to over- 
come her diſcretion, for, though the con- 

tents 


6345) 


tents of the note to Schedoni could not 
poſitively have betrayed him, had he even 
been in Naples at this time, her ſending it 
to the Spitito Santo, inftead of the place 
which he had appointed for his letters, 
might have led to a premature diſcovery 
reſpecting herſelf. 

While Ellena had acquainted Olivia 
that Schedoni would probably be with 
them ſoon, ſhe watched cagerly for the 
joyful ſurprize ſhe expected would appear 
on her countenance; how: ſevere then 
was her diſappointment when only terror 
and difmay were expreſſed there! and, 
when, in the next moment, her mother 
_ uttered cxclamations of diſtreſs and even 
of deſpair ! : 

If he fees me,” mid Olivia, © I am 
irrecoverably loſt! O! unhappy Ellena! 
your precipitancy has deſtroyed me. The 
original of this portrait is not the Count di 
Bruno, ' my dear lord, nor your parent, 
but his brother, the cruel huſband” 


75 


Olivia 


( 346 ) 


Olivia left the ſentence unfiniſhed, as 
if ſhe was betraying more than was at 
preſent diſcreet ; but Ellena, whom aflo- 
niſhment had kept ſilent, now entreated 
that ſhe would explain her ' words, and 
the cauſe of her diſtreſs, 

« I know not,” ſaid Olivia, “ by what. 
means that portrait has been conveyed to 
you; but it is the reſemblance of the 
Count Ferando di Bruno, the brother of 
my lord, and my” ſecond huſband ſhe 


ſhould have ſaid, but her lips refuſed to 
honour him with the title, 


She pauſed and was much affected, but 
preſently added— 

e cannot at preſent explain the ſubject 
more fully, for it 1s to me a very diſtreſſing 
one. Let me rather conſider the means 
of avoiding an interview with di Bruno, 
and even of concealing, if poſſible, that 
I exiſt.” 

Olivia was, however, ſoothed when ſhe 
underſtood that Ellena bad not named her 

in 


6 


in the note, but had merely deſired to ſee 
the Confeſſor upon a very particular oc- 
caſion. N 
While they were conſulting upon the 
excuſe it would be neceſſary to form for 
this imprudent ſummons, the meſſenger 
returned with the note unopened, and 
with information, that father Schedoni 
was abroad on a pilgrimage, which was 
the explanation the brothers of the Spirito 
Santo choſe to give of his abſence; judg- 
ing it prudent, for the honour of their 
convent, to conceal his real ſituation. 
Olivia, tbus releaſed from her fears, 
conſented to explain ſome points of the 
ſubje&amp; ſo intereſting to Ellena; but it 
was not till ſeveral days after this diſcovery, 
that ſhe could ſufficiently command her 
ſpirits to relate the whole of her narrative. 
The firſt part of it agreed perfectly with the 
account delivered in the conſeſſion to the 
penitentiary Anſaldo; that which follows 
was Known only to herſelf, her ſiſter

( 348 ) 


Bianchi, a phyſician, and one faithſut 
ſervant, who had been conſiderably en- 
truſted with the conduct of the plan. 

It may be recollected that Schedoni 
left his houſe immediately after the 
act, which was deſigned to be fatal to 
the Counteſs his wife, and that ſhe was 
carried ſenſeleſs to her chamber. The 
wound,. as appears, was not mortal. But 
the atrocity of the intent determined her 
to ſeize the opportunity thus offered by 
the abſence of Schedoni, and her own 
peculiar circumſtances, to releaſe herſelſ 
from his tyranny without having recourſe 
to a court of juſtice, which would have 
covered with infamy the brother of her 
firſt huſband. She withdrew, there- 
fore, from his houſe for ever, and, with 
the aſſiſtance of the three perſons beforc- 
mentioned, retired to a remote part ot 
Italy, and fought refuge in the convent ol 
San Stefano, while at home the report of her 
death was confirmed by a * ſuneral. 

Bianchi 


1800 


Bianchi remained for ſome time after the 
departure of Olivia, in her own reſidence 


near the Villa di Bruno, having taken 


under her immediate care the daughter of 


the Counteſs and of the firſt Count di 


Bruno, as well as an infant daughter of 
the ſecond. 


After ſome time had elapſed, Bianchi 


withdrew with her young charge, but not 
to the neighbourhood of San Stefano. 
The indulgence of a mother's tenderneſs 
was denied to Olivia, for Bianchi could 
not reſide near the convent without ſub- 
= jecting her to the hazard of a diſcovery, 
| ſince Schedoni, though he now believed 
the report of her death, might be led to 
doubt it, by the conduct of Bianchi, 
whoſe ſteps would probably be obſerved 
by him. She choſe a reſidence, therefore, 
at a diſtance from Olivia, though not yet at 
Altieri. At this period, Ellena was not two 
years old; tlie daughter of Schedoni was 
ſcarcely as many months, and ſhe died

before the year concluded. Tt was this his 
child, for whom the Confeflor, who had 
too well concealed himſelf to permit Bianchi 
to acquaint him with her death, had miſ- 
taken Ellena, and to which miſtake his 
own portrait, affirmed by Ellena to be 
that of her father, had contributed. This 
miniature ſhe had found in the cabinet of 
Bianchi after her aunt's deceaſe, and, ob- 
ſerving it inſcribed with the title of Count 
di Bruno, ſhe had worn it with a filial 
fondneſs ever ſince that period. 

Bianchi, when ſhe had acquainted 
Ellena with the ſecret of her birth, was 
withheld, both by prudence and humanity, 


from entruſting her with a knowledge that 


her mother lived ; but this, no doubt, was 
the circumſtance ſhe appeared ſo anxious 
to diſcloſe on her death-bed, when the 
ſuddenneſs of her diſorder had deprived 
her of the power. The abruptneſs of 
that event had thus contributed to keep 
the mother and daughter unknown to 

each

each other, even when they afterwards 
accidentally met, to which concealment 
the name of Roſalba, given to Ellena 
from her infancy by Bianchi, for the pur- 
poſe of protecting her from diſcovery by 
her uncle, had aſſiſted. Beatrice, who 
was not the domeſtic intruſted with the 
eſcape of Olivia, had beheved the report 
of her death, and thus, though ſhe knew 
Ellena to be the daughter of the Counteſs 
di Bruno, ſhe could never have been a 
means of diſcovering them to each other, 
had it not happened that Olivia recognized 
this ancient ſervant of Bianchi, while 
Ellena was preſent. 

When Bianchi came to reſide in the 
neighbourhood of Naples, ſhe was unſuſ- 
picious that Schedom, who had never 
been heard of ſince the night of the aſſaſ- 
ination, inhabited there; and ſthe fo 
ſeldom left her houſe, that it is not ſur- 
prizing ſhe ſhould never happen to meet 
him, at leaſt conſciouſly; for her veil, 

and 


(6) 


and the monk's cowl, might eaſily have 
concealed them from - each other if they 
had met. 

It appears to have been the intention of 
Bianchi to diſcloſe to Vivaldi the family of 
Ellena, before their nuptials were ſolem- 


nized ; fince, on the evening of their laſt 


converſation, ſhe had declared, when her 
ſpirits were exhauſted by the exertion ſhe 
had made, that much remained for her to 
ſay, which weakneſs obliged her to defer 


till another opportunity, Her unexpected 


death prevented any future meeting. 


That ſhe had not ſooner intended to make 


a communication, which might have re- 
moved, in a conſiderable degree, the ob- 
jection of the Vivaldi to a connection with. 
Ellena, appears extraordinary, till other 
circumſtances of her family than that of 


its nobility are conſidered. Her preſent 


indigence, and yet more, the guilt attach- 


ed to an individual of the di Bruno, it was 


xcaſonable to ſuppoſe would operate as a 
| | ſul! 


"ver. 


( 353 ) 


ſull antidote to the allurement of rank, 
however jealous of birth the Vivaldi had 
proved themſelves. 

Ferando di Bruno had contrived, even 
in the ſhort interval between the death of 
his brother and the ſuppoſed deceaſe of 
his wife, again to embarraſs his affairs, 
and ſoon after his flight, the income ariſ- 
ing from what remained of his landed 
property had been ſeized upon by his 


creditors, whether lawfully or not, he 


was then in a fituation which did not per- 
mit him to conteſt, and Ellena was thus 
left wholly dependent upon her aunt. 
The ſmall fortune of Bianchi had been 
diminiſhed by the aſſiſtance ſhe afforded 
Olivia, for whoſe admittance into the 
convent of San Steſano it had been neceſ- 
fary to advance a conſiderable ſum ; and 
her original income was afterwards re- 
duced by the purchaſe of the villa Altieri. 
This expenditure, however, was not an 


imprudent one, fince ſhe preferred the 
| comforts 


( 334 ) 


comforts and independence of a pleaſant 
home, with induſtry, to the indulgence 
of an indolence which muſt have confined 
her to an inferior refidence; and was 
acquainted with the means of making this 
induſtry profitable without being diſho- 
nourable. She excelled in many elegant 
and ingenious arts, and the productions 
of her pencil and ncedle were privately 
diſpoſed of to the nuns of La Picta, 
When Ellena was of an age to aſſiſt her, 
ſhe refigned much of the employment 
and the profit to her niece, whoſe 
genius having unfolded itſelf, the beauty 
of her deſigns and the elegance of her 
execution, both in drawings and em- 
broidery, were fo highly valued by the 
purchaſers at the grate of the convent, that 
Bianchi committed to Ellena altogether the 
exerciſe of her art. 

Olivia meanwhile had dedicated her life 
to devotion in the monaſtery of San Ste- 
fano, a choice which was willingly made 

while 


* - \ ot 1 * 4 * F 2 a K * &gt; 
r Se 


(955) 


while her mind was yet ſoftened by grief 
for the death of her firſt lord, and wearied 
by the cruelty ſhe had afterwards experi- 
enced. The firſt years of her retirement 
were paſſed in tranquility, except when the 
remembrance of her child, whom ſhe did 
not dare to ſee at the convent, awakened 
a parental pang. With Bianchi ſhe, 
however, correſponded as regularly as 
opportunity would allow, and had at leaſt 
the conſolation of knowing, that the ob- 
jet moſt dear to her lived, till, within a 
ſhort period of Ellena's arrival at the 
very aſylum choſen by her mother, her 
apprehenſions were in ſome degree excited 
by the-unuſual filence of Bianchi. 

When Olivia had firſt ſeen Ellena in 
the chapel of San Stefano, ſhe was ſtruck 
with a ſlight reſemblance ſhe bore to the 
late Count di Bruno, and had frequently 
afterwards examined her features with a 
moſt painful curiofity ; but, circumſtanced 
as ſhe was, Olivia could not reaſonably 


ſuſpect 


1 


ſuſpect the ſtranger to be her daughter, 
Once, however, a ſenſe of this poſſibility 
fo far overcame her judgment, as to 
prompt an inquiry for the ſurname of 
Ellena ; but the mention of Roſalba had 
checked all further conjecture. What 
would have been the feclings of the nun, 
had ſhe been told when her generous 
compaſſion was aſſiſting a ſtranger to 
eſcape from oppreſſion, that ſhe was pre- 
ſerving her own child! It may be worthy 


of obſervation, that the virtaes of Olivia, 
exerted in a general cauſe, had thus led 


her unconſciouſly to the happineſs of 
faving her daughter; while the vices of 
Schedoni had as unconſciouſly urged him 
nearly to deſtroy his niece, and had always 
been preventing, by the means they 


promptcd him to employ, the ſucceſs of 


his conſtant aim.

] enn of "whats 
death Beatrice had given an imperfect 
account, ſtruck with remorſe of the crime 
ſhe had meditated againſt Ellena, and 
with terror of the puniſhment due to it, 
had ſent, when on her death-bed, for a 
Confeſſor, to whom the unburthened her 
conſcience, and from whom ſhe hoped. 
to receive, in return, an alleviation of 
her deſpair. This Confeſſor was a man 
of good ſenſe and humanity; and, when 
he fully underſtood the ſtory of Vivaldi 
and Ellena di Roſalba, he declared, that 

td, her 


6 


her only hope of forgiveneſs, both {or 
the crime ſhe had meditated, and the un- 
deſerved ſufferings ſhe had occaſioned, 
reſted upon her willingneſs to make thoſe 
now happy, whom ſhe had formerly ren- 
dered miſerable. Her conſcience had al- 
ready given her the ſame leſſon; and, 
now that ſhe was ſinking to that grave 
which levels all diſtinctions, and had 
her juſt fear of retribution no longer op- 
poſed by her pride, ſhe became as anxious 
to promote the marriage of Vivaldi with 
Ellena as ſhe had ever been to prevent it, 
She ſent, therefore, for the Marcheſe; 
and, having made an avowal of the arts 
ſhe had practiſed againſt the peace and 
reputation of Ellena, without, however 
confeſſing the full extent of her intended 
crimes, ſhe made it her laſt requeſt, that 
he would conſent to the happineſs of 

his ſon. 
The Marcheſe, howeyer, ſhocked as 
he was at this diſcovery of the duplicity 
and 


6 


and cruelty of his wife, had neither her 
terror of the future, or remorſe for the 
paſt, to overcome his objection to the 
rank of Ellena; and he reſiſted all 
her importunity, till the anguiſh of her 
laſt hours vanquiſhed every conſideration 
but that of affording her relief; he then 
gave a ſolemn promiſe, in the preſence 
of the Confeſſor, that he would no lon- 
ger oppoſe the marriage of Vivaldi and 
Ellena, ſhould the former perſiſt in his 
attachment to her. This promiſe was 
ſufficient for the Marcheſa, and ſhe died 
with ſome degree of reſignation. It did 
not, however, appear probable, that the 
Marcheſe would ſoon be called upon to 
fulfil the engagements, into which he had 
ſo unwillingly entered, every inquiry after 
Vivaldi having been hitherto ineffectual. 
During the progreſs of this fruitleſs 
ſearch for his ſon, and while the Mar- 
cheſe was almoſt lamenting him as dead, 
the inhabitants of the Vivaldi palace 
were, 


( 360 ) 


were one night arouſed from ſleep by a 
violent knocking at the great gate of tlie 


court. The nome was ſo loud and inceſ- 


fant, that, before the porter could obcy 
the ſummons, the Marcheſe, whoſe apart- 
ment looked upon the court, was alarm- 
ed, and he ſent an attendant from his ante- 

room, to inquire the occaſion of it. 
Preſently a voice was . heard from the 
firſt ante- chamber, exclaiming, *I muſt 
ſee my Lord Marcheſe directly; he will 
not be angry to be- waked, when he 
knows all about it;“ and, before the 
Marcheſe could order that no perſon, on 
whatever pretence, ſhould be admitted, 
Paulo, haggard, ragged, and covered with 
cirt, was in the chamber. His wan and 
affrighted countenance, his diſordered 
dreſs, and his very attitude, as on enter” 
ing he half turned to look back upon 
the ante-rooms, like one, who, juſt eſ- 
caped from bondage, : liſtens to the fan- 
cied ſounds of. purſuit, were altogether, 
| ſo 


— S _— ; — — y 


01) 


ſo firiking and terrific, that the Marcheſe, 
anticipating ſome dreadtul news of Vi- 
valdi, had ſcarcely power to inquire for 
him. Paulo, however, rendered quel{- 
tions unneceſſary; for, without any cir- 
cumlocution, or preiace, he immedi- 
aiely informed the Marcheſe, that the 
Signor, his dear maſter, was in the pri- 
ſens of the Inquiſition, at Rome, if, in- 
deed, they had not put an end to him be- 
ſore that time.” 

Les, my Lord,” ſaid Paulo, I am 
| juſt got out myſelf, for they would not 
let me he with the Signor, ſo it was of 


was a hard matter with me to go away, 
and leave my dear maſter within thoſe 
| diſmal walls; and nothing ſhould have 
perſuaded me to do ſo, but that I hoped, 


nor was, you might be able to get him 
I out. But there is not a minute to be loft, 
2 my Lord, for when once a gentleman has 
vol. 111, Q_ got 


no uſe to ſtay there any longer. Yet it 


uhen your Lordſhip knew where the Sig- 


Nel

got within the claws of thoſe inquiſitors, 
there is no knowing how ſoon they may 
take it in their heads to tear him in 
pieces. Shall I order horſes for Rome, 
my Lord? I am ready to ſet off again 
directly,” 

The ſuddenneſs of ſuch intelligence, 
concerning an only ſon, might have agi- 
tated ſtronger nerves than thoſe of the 
Marcheſe, and ſo much was he ſhocked 
by it, that he could not immediately de- 
termine how to proceed, or give any 
anſwer to Paulo's repeated queſtions. 
When, however, he became ſufficiently 
recollected to make further inquiry into 
the ſituation of Vivaldi, he perceived the 
neceſſity of an immediate journey; but 
firſt it would be prudent to conſult with 
ſome friends, whoſe connections at Rome 
might þe a means of greatly facilitating 
the important purpoſe, which led bim 
thither, and this could not be done till 
the following morning. Yet he gave 
orders, that preparation ſhould be made

for his ſetting out at a moment's notice; 
and, having liſtened to as full an account 
as Paulo could give of the paſt and pre- 
ſent circumſtances of Vivaldi, he diſ- 
miſſed him to repoſe for the remainder of 
the niglit. 
Paulo, however, though much in want 
of reſt, was in too great an agitation of 
ſpirits either to ſeek or to find it; and the 
fear he had indicated, on entering the 
iarcheſe's apartment, proceeded from 
the hurry of his mind, rather than from 
any poſitive apprehenſion of new evil. 
For Ins liberty he was indebted to the 
young centinel, who had on a former oc- 
caſion been removed from the door of 
his priſon, but who, by means of the 
guard, to whom Vivaldi bad given mo-

um nicate with him. This man, of a na- 
till i ture too humane for his ſituation, was

expiration of the time, for which he had 
been engaged. Le thought that to be 
a guard over priſoners was nearly as mi- 
ferablc as being a priſoner himſelf. * 
ſee no difference between them,“ ſaid he, 
except that the priſoner watches on one 
{ide of the door, and the centincl on the 
other.” 

With the reſolution to releaſe himfell, 
he conferred with Paulo, whoſe good na-- 
ture and feeling heart, among to many 
people of a contrary character, had won 
his confidence and affection, and he laid 
his plan of cicape ſo well, that it was on 
the point of ſucceeding, when Paulo s 
obſiinacy in attempting an nnpoſhibility 
had nearly counteracted the whole. It 
went to his heart, he ſaid, to leave his 
maſter in priſon, While he himſelf was 
to march off in ſafcty, and he would 
run the riſk of his neck, rather than 
have ſuch a deed upon his head. IIe

propeted, therefore, as Vivaldi's guards 


were of two ferocious a nature to be tam- 
pered with, to ſcale a wall of the court, 
into which a grate: of Vivaldi's dungeon 
looked. But had this loſty wall been 
practicable, the grate was not; and the 
attempt had nearly coſt Paulo not only 
his liberty but his life. 

When, at length, he had made his 
way through the perilous avenues of the 
priſon, and was fairly beyond the walls, 
he could hardly be prevailed upon by his 
companion to leave them. For near an 
hour, he wandered under their ſhade, 
weeping and exclaiming, and calling up- 
on his dear maſter, at the evident hazard 
of being retaken; and probably would 
have remained there much longer, had 
not the dawn of morning rendered his 
companion deſperate, Juſt, however, as 
the man was forcing him away, Paulo 
fancied he diſtinguiſhed, by the ftrength- 
ening light, the roof of that particu»

tar building, in whoſe dungeon his maf- 
ter was confined, and the appearance 
of Vivaldi himſelf could ſcarcely have 
occahtoned a more tudden burſt of joy; 
ſucceeded by one of grief. © It is the 
roof, it is the very roof!” exclaimed 
Paulo, vaulting. from the ground, and 
clapping his hands; „ it is the roof, the 
roof! O, my maſter, my maſter ! the 
roof, the roof!“ He continued alter- 
nately to exclaim, My maſter! the 
roof! my maſter! the roof!“ till his 
companion began to fear he was frantic, 
whtle tears ſtreamed down his cheeks, 
and every look and geſture expreſſed the 
moſi extravagant and whimſical union of 
joy and ſorrow. At length, the abſolute 
terror of diſcovery compelled his compu- 
nion to force him from the ſpot ; when, 
having loſt ſight of the building which 
incloſed Vivaldi, he ſet off tor Naples 
with a ſpeed that defied all interruption, 


and arrived there in the condition which 
has 


6387 


has been mentioned, having taken no 
ſleep, and ſcarcely any ſuſtenance, ſince 
he leſt the Inquiſition. Yet, though in this 
exhauſted ftate, the ſpirit of his affection 
remained unbroken, and when, on the 
following morning, the Marcheſe quit- 
ted Naples, neither his wearineſs, nor 
the imminent danger, to which this jour- 
ney muſt expoſe him, could prevent his 
attending him to Rome. 
The rank of the Marcheſe, and the 
influence he was known to poſſeſs at 
the court of Naples, were circumſtances 
that promiſed to have weight with the 
Holy Office, and to procure Vivaidi a 
ſpeedy releaſe; but yet more than theſe 
were the high connections, which the 
Count di Maro, the friend of the Mar— 
cheſe, had in the church of Rome. 
The applications, however, which were 
made to the inquiſitors, were not ſo ſoon. 
rephed to as the wiſhes of the Marcheſe 
had expected, and he had been above a

fortnight in that city, before he was even 
permitted to viſit his ton. In this inter. 
view, affection predominated on both 
ſides over all remembrance of the paſt. 
The condition of Vivaldi, his faded ay- 
pearance, to which the wounds he had 
received at Celano, and from which he was 
icarcely recovered, had contributed; and 
his fituation in a melancholy and terrible 
priton, were circumſtances that awaken 
all the tenderneſs of the father ; his errois 
were forgiven, and the Marcheſe felt dil- 
poſed to conſent to all that might reſtore 
him to happineſs, could he but be reſtored 
to liberty. 

Vivaldi, when informed of his mothers 
death, ſhed bitter tears of ſorrow and re- 
- morſe, for having occaſioned her ſo much 
uncaſineſs. The unreaſonableneſs of her 
claims was forgotten, and her faults were 
extenuated ; happily, indeed,for his peace, 
the extent of her criminal deſigns he had 
never underſtood; and when he learned 


that

that her dying requeſt had been in- 
tended to promote his happineſs, the 
cruel conſciouſneſs of having interrupted 
her's occaſioned him ſevere anguiſh, and 
he was obliged to recollect her former 
conduct towards Ellena at San Stefano 
before he could become reconciled to him-

'v Your's in the ranks of death.“ 
SHAKESPEARE, 


Neax three weeks had clapſed fince 
the Marcheſe's arrival at Rome, and not 
any deciſive anſwer was returned by the 
Inquiſition to his application, when he 
and Vivaldi received at the ſame time a 
ſummons to attend father Schedoni in his 
dungeon. To meet the man who had 
occaſioned ſo much ſuffering to his family 
was extremely painful to the Marcheſe, 
but he was not allowed to refuſe the inter- 
view ; and at the hour appointed he called 
at the chamber of Vivaldi; and, followed 
by two officials, they paſſed on together 
to that of Schedoni. 

While 


Enn ) 


While they waited at the door of the 
priſon- room, till the numerous bars and 
locks were unfaſtened, the agitation, which 
Vivaldi had ſuffered, on receiving the 
ſummons, returned with redoubled force, 
now that he was about to behold, once 
more, that wretohed man, who had an- 
nounced himſelf to be the parent of El- 
lena di Roſalba. The Marcheſe ſuffered: 
emotions of a different nature, and with. 
his reluctance to fee Schedoni was min- 
gled a degree of curiofity as to the event, 
which had occaſioned this ſummons. 

The door being thrown open, the offi- 
eials entered firſt, and the Marcheſe and 
Vivaldi, on following, difcovered the 
Confeſſor lying on a mattreſs. He did 
not riſe to receive them, but,. as he lifted. 
his head, and bowed it in obeitance, his 
countenance, upon which the little light 
admitted through the triple grate of his 
dungeon gleamed, ſeemed more than: 


' uſually ghaſtly; his eyes were hollow, 
N A 6 and 


1 77 


and his ſhrunk ſeatures appeared as it 
death had already touched them. V. 
valdi, on perceiving him, groancd, and 
averted his face ; but, ſoon recovering a 


command of himſelf, he approached the 
mattreſs. 


The NMarcheſe, ſuppreſſing every ex- 
preſſion of reſentment towards an enemy, 
who was reduced to this deplorable con- 
dition, inquired what he had to communt- 
cate. 

«© Where is ſather Nicola?“ ſaid Schie- 
dom to an official, without attending tc 
the queſtion :- * do not ſee him here. I: 
he gone fo ſoon, and without having heard 


the purport of my ſummons ? Let him be 
called.” 


Ihe official ſpoke to a centinel, who 
immediately left the chamber. 

«© Who are theſe that ſurround me:“ 
laid Schedoni. Who is he that ſtands 
at the foot of the bed?“ While he ſpoke, 
he bent his eyes on Vivaldi, who reſted

in deep dejection there, and was loſt in 
thought, till, arouted by Schedoni) 8 voice; 
he replied, 
it is I, Vincentio di Vivaldi; I obey 
your requiſition, and inquire the purpoſe 
of it!“ 
The Marcheſe repeated the demand, 
Schedoni appeared to meditate ; ſome— 
times he fixed his eyes upon Vivaldi, for 
an inſtant, and when he withdrew them, 
he ſeemed to fink into deeper thoughtful- 
. neſs. As he raited them once again, they 
aſſumed a ſingular expreſſion of wildneſs, 
and then fettling, as if on a vacancy, 2 
| ſudden glare ſhot from them, while he 
ſuid—“ Who is he, that glides there ia 
the duſk ?” 
o il His eyes were directed beyond Vivaldi, 
Who, on turning, perceived the monk, 
ſather Nicola, paſſing behind him.

truth of what I ſhall. declare,” replied 
Schedoni, 

Nicola, and an inquiſitor who had ac- 
companied him, immediately arranged 
themſelves on. one fide of. the bed, while 
the Marcheſe ſtationed himiclf on the 
other. Vivaldi remained at its foot. 

Schedoni, after a pauſe, began: That 
which I have to make known relates to 
the cabal formerly carried on by him, the 
father Nicola, and myſelf, againſt the 
peace of an innocent young woman, 
whom, at my inſtigation, he has baſely 
traduced.” 

At theſe words, Nicola attempted to 
interrupt the Confeſſor, but Vivaldi re- 
ftrained him: 

« Ellena di Roſalba is known to you?“ 
continued Schedoni, addreſſing the Mar- 
cheſe. 

Vivaldi's countenance changed at this 
abrupt mention of Ellena, but he re- 


mained ſilent. 
; « I have 


2

(37S } 


I have heard of her,” replied the: 
Marchefe, coldly. 

And you have heard falſely of her,” 
rejoined Schedoni. Lift your eyes, my 
lord Marcheſe, and ſay, do you not re- 
collect that face?“ pointing to Nicola. 

The Marcheſe regarded the monk at- 
tentively, It is a face not eaſily to be 
forgotten,” he replied ; © I remember to 
have ſcen it more than once.“ 

Where have you ſeen him, my 
Lord?“ 

In my own palace, at Naples; and 
you yourſelf introduced him to me 
there.”

© Why, then, do you now accuſe him 
of falſehood,” obſerved the Marcheſe,

ſuſpected, the flanderer of Ellena di Ro-

«© Moſt truc,* rejoined Schedoni; 
e and it is for the purpoſe of vindicat- 
ing 7 | 

And you acknowledge yourtelf to be 
the author of thoſe infamous flanders !” 
paſſionately interrupted Vivaldi ;—© you 
who but lately declared yourſelf to be her 
father !” 

In the inſtant that Vivaldi had uttered 
this, he became ſenſible of bis indiſcre- 
tion, for till now he had avoided inform- 
ing the Marcheſe, that Ellena had been 
declared the daughter of Schedoni. This 
abrupt diſeloſure, and at ſuch a moment, 
he immediately perceived might be fatal 
to his hopes, and that the Marchese 
would not conſider the promiſe he had 
given to his dying wife, however ſolemn, 
as binding, under circumſtances ſo pecu- 
Tar and unſoreſcen as the preſent. The 
aſtoniſhment. of the Marcheſe, upon this

diſcovery, cannot eafily be imagined 3 
hne looked at his ſon for an explanation of 
what he had heard, and then with in- 
created deteſtation on the Conteſlor ; but 
Vivaldi was not in a ſtate of mind to 
give any explanation at this moment, 
and he requeſted his father to ſuſpend 
even his coujectures till he could converſe 
with him alone. 

The Marchefe deſiſted for the preſent 
from further inquiry, but it was obvious 
that his opinion and his refolution, re- 
ipecting the marriage of Vivaldi, were al- 
ready formed. 

« You, then, are the author of thoſe 


Tanders !” repeated Vivaldi. 


© 


« Hear me!“ cried Schedoni, in a 
voice which the ſtrength of his ſpirit 
contending with the feebleneſs of his 
condition, rendered hollow and terrible. 
— Tear me!“ 

He ſtopped, unable to recover im- 
mediately from the effect of the exez- 

4 tion 


( 378 ) 
tion he had made. At length, he re- 
tumed, 

J have declared, and J continue to 
declare, that Ellena di Rotalba, as ſhe 
has been named, for the purpoſe, I con- 
jecture, of concealing her from an un- 
_ worthy father, is my daughter!“ 

Vivaldi groancd in the exceſs of his 
deſpair, but made no further attempt to 
interrupt Schedoni. The Marcheſe was 
not equally paſſive. © And was it to lit- 
ten to a vindication of your daughter,” 
ſaid he, © that I have been ſummoned 
hither? But let this Signora Roſalba, 
be who ſhe may, of what importance can 


it be to me whether ſhe is innocent or 


otherwiſe !” 

Vivaldi, with the utmoſt difficulty, 
forbore to expreſs the feelings, which 
this ſentence excited. It appeared to re- 
call all the ſpirit of Schedoni. She 1: 
the daughter of a noble houſe,” ſaid the 
Confeſſor, haughtily, while he half raiſed 


him-

nimſelf from his mattreſs. In me 
ou behold the laſt of the Counts di 
Bruno.” 
The Marcheſe fmiled contemptuouſly, 
Schedoni proceeded. © I call upon 


von, Nicola di Zampari, who have de- 
| clared yourſelf, on a late occaſion, ſo 


ſirenuous for juſtice; I call upon you now 
to do juſtice in this inſtance, and to ac- 
knowledge, before theſe witneſſes, that 


| Ellena Roſalba is innocent of every cir- 
cumſtance of miſconduct, which you have 


formerly related to the Marcheſe di Vi- 


| yaldi 1” 


% Villain ! do you hefitate,” ſaid Vi- 
valdi to Nicola, © to retract the cruel 


llanders, which you have thrown upon her 


name, and which have been the means of 


deſtroying her peace, perhaps for ever? 


&gt;, 


Do you perſiſt 
The Marcheſe interrupted his fon :—

for a purpoſe, that does not concer: 
me. 

Before the Confeſſor could reply, the 
Marcheſe had turned from him to gt 
the chamber; but the vehemence of . 
valdi's diſtreſs prevailed with him ig 
pauſe, and thus allowed him to undes 
ſtand from Schedoni, that the juſtification 
of the innocent Ellena, though it had 
been mentioned firſt, as being the obie(t 
neareſt to his heart, was not the only one, 
that had urged him to require this meet— 
ing. 

If you conſent,” added Schedoni, 
* to liſten to the vindication of my child, 
you ſhall afterwards perceive, Signor, 
that I, fallen though I am, have ſtil been 
defirons of eounteraQing, as far as re- 
mains for me, the evil I have occaſion. 
You ſhall acknowledge, that what I then 
make known 1s of the utmoſt conſequence? 
to the repoſe of the Marcheſe di Vival!, 
high in influence, and haughty in pro- 
perity as he now appears.” | 


The 


(nn 


The latter part of this aſlurance threat- 
ened to overcome the effect of the firſt; 
the pride of the Marcheſe ſwelled high; 
he took ſome ſteps towards the door, but 
then ſtopped, and, conjecturing that the 
ſubject, to winch Schedoni alluded, con- 


5 cerned the liberation of his fon, he con- 
5 ſented to attend to what Nicola ſhould 
by | ULICIOTE, 

p This monk, mcanwhile, had been ba- 
0 lancing the neceſfity for acknowledging 
N himfelf a Tlandercr, again the poflibi- 
— ity Of avoiding it; and it was the reſo- 
i lute manner of Vivaldi, who appeared 
ny have no doubt as to his guilt in this

Or, | conſequence of perſiſting in falſchood, 
WW wt either remorſe of conſcience, or the 
1 appeal of Schedoni. IIe acknowledged 
then, after. conſiderable circumlocution, 
en 


in which he contrived to defend himſelf, 
by throwing all the odium of the original 
deſign upon the Conteilor, that he had 
| been 


1 


been prevailed upon by his arts to impoſe | 
on the credulity of the Marcheſe, reſpect. | 
ing the conduct of Ellena di Rofalha, | 
This avowal was made upon oath, and 
Schedoni, by the queſtions he put to him, 
was careful it ſhould be ſo full and cir- 
cumſtantial that even the moſt prejudiced 
hearer muſt have been convinced of it: 
truth; while the moſt unfceling mull 
have yielded for once to indignation 
againſt the aſperſer, and pity of the | 
aſperſed. Its effect upon the preſent au- 
ditors was various. The Marcheſe had 
liſtened to the whole explanation with an 
unmoved countenance, but with profound 
attention. Vivaldi had remained in a 
fixed attitude, with eyes bent on father 
Nicola, in ſuch cager and ftern regard, 
as ſeemed to ſearch into his very ſoul ; 
and, when the monk concluded, a ſmile 
of triumphant Joy lighted up his features, 
as he looked upon the Marcheſe, and 
claimed an acknowledgment of his con- 
viction. 

4 


6 


viction that Ellena had been calumniated. 


The cold glance, which the Marcheſe re- 
turned, ſtruck the impaſſioned and ge- 
nerous Vivaldi to the heart, who perceived 
that he was not only totally indifferent as 


to the injuſtice, which an innocent and 


helpleſs young woman had ſuffered, but 
fancied that he was unwilling to admit 
the truth, which his judgment would no 
longer allow him to reject. 

Schedoni, meanwhile, appeared almoſt 
to writhe under the agony, winch his mind 
inflicted upon him, and it was only by 
firong efforts, that he ſuſtained his ſpirit 
ſo far as to go through with the interroga- 
tions he had judged it neceflary to put to 
Nicola. When the ſubject was finiſhed, 
he ſunk back on his pillow, and cloſing 
his eyes, a hue ſo pallid, ſucceeded by 
one ſo livid, overſpread his features, that 
Vivaldi for an inſtant believed he was dy- 
ing; and in this ſuppoſition he was not 
fiingular, for even an official was touched 
with 


_ 
f &gt; , 


Ih 4 "#1 


538 


with the Confeſſor's condition, and bag 


advanced to aſſiſt him, when he unc log 
his eyes, and ſeemed to revive. 

The Marcheſe, without making an 
comment upon the avowal of father N. 
cola, demanded, on its concluſion, t! 
diſcloſure, which Schedoni had aſſerted to 

2 intimately connected with his peace : 
and the latter now inquired of a perſon 
near him, whether a ſecretary of the In- 
canton was in the chamber, who he had 
requeſted might attend, to take a forma! 
depolition of what he ſhould declare 
He was anſwered, that ſuch an one was 
already in waiting. Ile then aſked, what 
other perions were in the room, addin-, 


* « 
116 


that he ſhould require inquiſitorial wit— 
neſſes to his depofition ; and was anſwer— 
ed, that an inquiſitor and two officials 
were preſent, and that their evidence was 
more than ſufficient for his purpoſe. 

A lamp was then called for by the 
tecretary ; but, as that could not imme- 
| diatelsy 


) 


diately be procured, the torch of one of 
the centinels, who watched in the dark 
avenue without, was brought in its ſtead, 
and this diſcovered to Schedoni the va- 
rious figures aſſembled in his duſky cham- 
ber, and to them the emaciated form and 
ghaſtly viſage of the Conſeſſor, As Vi- 
valdi now beheld him by the ſtronger 
light of the torch, he again fancied that 
death was in his aſpect. 

Every perſon was now ready for the 
declaration of Schedoni; but he himſelf 
ſeemed not fully prepared. He remained 
for ſome moments reclining on his pillow 
in filence, with his eyes ſhut, while the 
changes in his features indicated the ſtrong 
emotion of bis mind. Then, as if by a 
violent effort, he half raiſed himſelf, and 
made an ample confeſſion of the arts he 
had practiſed againſt Vivaldi. He de- 
clared himſelf to be the anonymous ac- 
cuſer, who had cauſed him to be arreſted 
by the Holy Office, and that the charge 

VOL, III. R of 


41 


ef herefy, which he had brought againſt 
him, was falſe and malicious. 

At the moment when Vivaldi received 
this confirmation of his ſuſpicions, as to 
the identity of his accuſer, he diſcovered 
more fully that the charge was not what 
had been ſtated to him at the chapel of 
San Sebaſtian, in which Ellena was im- 
plicated and he demanded an explana- 
tion of this circumſtance. Schedoni ac- 
knowledged, that the perſons, who had 
there arreſted him, were not officers of the 
Inquiſition, and that the inſtrument of 
arreſt, containing the charge of elope- 
ment with a nun, was forged by himſelf, 
for the purpoſe of empowering the ruf- 
fians to carry off Ellena, without oppoſi- 
tion from the inhabitants of the convent, 
in which ſhe was then lodged. 

To Vivaldi's inquiry, why it had been 
thought neceſſary to employ ſtratagem in 
the removal of Ellena, ſince, if Schedoni 
had only claimed her for his daughter, he 

4 might 


1337 


might have removed her without any, the 
Confeſſor replied, that he was then igno- 
rant of the relationſhip which exiſted be- 
tween them. But to the further inquiries, 
with what deſign, and whither Ellena 
had been removed, and the means by 
which he had diſcovered her to be his 
daughter, Schedoni was filent; and he 
ſunk back, overwhelmed by the recollec- 
tions they awakened. 

The depoſitions of Schedoni having 
been taken down by the ſecretary, were 
formally ſigned by the inquifitor and the 
officials preſent ; and Vivaldi thus ſaw his 
innocence vindicated by the very man who 
bad thrown him among the perils of the 
Inquiſition. But the near proſpect of 
releaſe now before him failed to affect 
him with joy, while he underſtood that 
Ellena was the daughter of Schedoni, the 
child of a murderer, whom he himſelf 
had been in ſome degree inſtrumental in 
bringing to a dreadful and 1gnominious 

R 2 death, 


(388) 


death. Still, however, willing to hope, 
that Schedoni had not ſpokep the truth 
concerning his relationſhip to Ellena, he 
claimed, in conſideration of the affection 
he had ſo long cheriſhed for her, a full 
explanation of the circumſtances conncct- 
ed with the diſcovery of her family. 

At this public avowal of his attach- 
ment, a haughty impatience appeared on 
the countenance of the Marcheſe, who 
forbade him to make further inquiry on 
the ſubject, and was immediately retiring 
from the chamber. 

My preſence is no longer neceſſary,” 
be added: the priſoner has concluded 
the only detail which I could be intereſted 
to hear from him; and, in confideration of 
the confeſſion he has made as to the in- 
nocence of my ſon, I pardon him the ſuſ- 
fering, which his falſe charge has occa- 
fioned to me and my family. The paper 
containing his depoſitious is given to ; our 
reſponſibility, holy father,” addreſſing 

1 the 


6389) 


the inquifitor; „ and you are required 
to lay it upon the table of the Holy Office, 
that the innocence of Vincentio di Vivaldi 
may appcar, and that he may be releaſed 
from theſe priſons without further delay. 
But, firſt, I demand a copy of thoſe decia- 
rations, and that the copy alſo ſhall be 
ſigned by the preſent witneſſes.“ 

The ſecretary was now bidden to copy 
them, and, while the Marcheſe waited to 
receive the paper (for he would not leave 
the chamber till he had ſecured it), Vi- 
valdi was urging his claim for an expla- 
nation reſpecting the family of Ellena, 
with unconquerable perſeverance. Sche- 
doni, no longer permitted to evade the 
inquiry, could not, however, give a cir— 
cumſtantial explanation, without partly 
diſclofing alſo the fatal deſigns which 
had been meditated by him and the late 
Marcheſa di Vivaldi, of whofe death he 
was ignorant; he related, therefore, lite 
tle more reſpecting Ellena than that a

portrait, which ſhe wore as being her ta- 
ther's, had firſt led to the diſcovery of her 
family. 

While the conſeſſor had been giving 
this brief explanation, Nicola, who was 
ſomewhat withdrawn from the circle, ſtood 
gazing at him with the malignity of a 
demon. His glowing eyes juſt appeared 
beneath the edge of his cowl, while, rolled 
up in his dark drapery, the lower featurcs 
of his face were muffled ; but the inter- 
mediate part of his countenance, receiv- 
ing the full glare of the torch, diſplayed 
all its ſpeaking and terrific lines. Vivaldi, 
as his eye glanced upon him, ſaw again 
the very monk of Paluzzi, and he thought 
he beheld alſo a man capable of the very 
crimes of which he had accuſed Schedoni. 
At this inſtant, he remembered the dread- 
ful garment that had been diſcovered in a 
dungeon of the fortreſs; and, yet more, 
be remembered the extraordinary circum- 
ſtances attending the deatiz of Bianchi, 

together 


„ 


together with the immediate knowledge 
which the monk had diſplayed of that 
event. Viraldr's fuſpicions reſpecting the 
cauſe of her death being thus revived, he 
determined to obtain, if poſſible, either a re- 
lief ſrom, or a confirmation of them; and 
he ſolemnly called upon Schedoni, Who, 
already condemned to die, had no longer 
any thing to fear from a diſcloſure of the 
truth, whatever it might be, to declare 
all that he knew on the ſubject. As he 
did fo, he looked at Nicola, to obſerve the 
effect of this demand, whoſe countenance 
was now, however, ſo much ſhrouded, 
that little of 1ts expreſſion conld be ſeen ; 
and Vivaldi remarked, that, while he had 
ſpoken, the monk drew his garment cloſer 
over the lower part of his face, and that 
he had immediately turned his eyes from 
him upon the Conſeſſor. 

With moſt ſolemn proteſtations, Sche- 
doni declared himſelf to be both innocent 


and ignorant of the cauſe of Bianchi's 


death.

Vivaldi then demanded by what means 
his agent, Nicola, had obtained ſuch im- 
mediate information, as the warning he 
had delivered at Paluzzi proved him to 
have, of an event, in which it appeared 
that he could be little intercſtcd ; and 
why that warning had been given. 

Nicola did not attempt to anticipate the 
reply of Schedoni, who, after a momen- 
tary ſilence, ſaid, © That warning, young 
man, was given to deter you from viſit- 
ing Alticri, as was every circumſtance of 
advice or intelligence, which you received 
beneath the arch of Paluzzi.“ 

Father,“ replied Vivaldi, “ you have 
never loved, or you would have fpared your- 
ſelf the practice of artifices ſo ineffectual 
to miſlead or to conquer a lover. Did you 
believe that an anonymous adviſer could 
have more influence with me than my 
affection, or that I could be terrified by 
ſuch ſtratagems into the. renunciation of 
its object?” | 
| „] be- 


43 
ee J believed,” rejoined the Confeſſor, 
ce that the diſintereſted advice of a ſtran- 
ger might have ſome weight with you; 
but I truſted more to the impreſſion of 
awe, which the conduct and feeming fore- 
knowledge of that ſtranger were adapted 
to inſpire in a mind like your's; and I 
thus endeayoured to avail myſelf of your 
prevailing weakneſs.” 

«© And what do you term my prevailing 
weakneſs,” ſaid Vivaldi, bluſhing. 

A ſuſceptibility which renders you 
eſpecially liable to ſuperſtition,” replied 
Schedoni. | 

„What! does a monk call ſuperſtition 
a weakneſs!” rejoined Vivaldi. © But 


grant he does, on what occafion. have I. 


betrayed ſuch weakneſs ?” 


% Have you forgotten a converſation 
which I once held with you on inviſible:

As he aſked this, Vivaldi was firuck 
with the tone of his voice; he thought it

was differeut from what he had remem- 
bered ever to have heard from him; and 
he looked at Schedoni more intently, that 
he might be certain it was he who had 
ſpoken. The Confeflor's eyes were fixed 
upon him, and he repeated ſlowly in the 
ſame tone, Have you forgotten ?” 

* ] have not forgotten the converſation 
to which you allude,” replied Vivaldi, 
&amp; and I do not recollect that 1 then diſ- 
cloſed any opinion that may juſtify your 
aſſertion.” 


The opinions you avowed were ra- 
tional,” ſaid Schedoni, “ but the ardour 


of your imagination was apparent; and 
what ardent imagination ever was con- 
tented to truſt to plain reaſoning, or to 
the evidence of the ſenſes? It may not 
willingly confine itſelf to the dull truths 
of this carth, but, eager to expand its 
facultics, to fill its capacity, and to expe- 
rience its own peculiar delights, ſoars after 
new wonders into a world of its own!“ 


Vivaldi 


„ 


Vivaldi bluſhed at this reproof, now 
conſcious of its juſtneſs; and was ſurpriſed 
that Schedoni ſhould ſo well have under- 
ſtood the nature of his mind, while he 
himſelf, with whom conjecture had never 
aſſumed the ſtability of opinion; on the 
ſubject to which the Confeſſor alluded, had 
been ignorant even of its propenſities. 

* I acknowledge the truth of your re- 
mark,” ſaid Vivaldi, “as far as it con- 
cerns myſelf. I have, however, inquiries 
to make on a point leſs abſtracted, and 
towards explaining which the evidence 
of my ſenſes themſelves have done little. 
To whom. belonged the bloody garments 
I found in the dungeon of Paluzzi, and 
what became of the perſon to whom they. 
had pertained?“ 

Contternation appeared for an inſtant 
on the features of Schedoni. What gar- 
ments?“ ſaid he. | 

% They appeared to be thoſe of a per- 
ſon who had died by violence, replied 

56 Vivaldi. 


( 396 ) 


Viraldi, © and they were diſcovercd in a 
place frequented by your avowed agent, 
Nicola, the monk.” 

As he concluded the ſentence, Vivaldi 
looked at Nicola, upon whom the atten- 
tion of every perſon preſent was now di- 
rected. 

« They were my own,” ſaid this 
monk. 

«© Your own! and in that condition! 

exclaimed Vivaldi. They were covered 
with gore!“ 
They were my own,” repeated Ni- 
cola. For their condition, I have to 
thank you,—the wound your piſtol gave 
me occaſtoned it.” 

Vivaldi was aſtoniſhed by this apparent 
ſubterſuge. I had no piſtol,” he re- 
joined, my ſword was my only wea- 
pon 

« Pauſe a moment,“ ſaid the monk. 


« ] repeat that I had no fire- arms, 
replied Vivaldi.

&amp; J appeal to father Schedoni,“ rejoined 
Nicola, whether I was not wounded by 
a piſtol ſhot.” 

Jo me you have no longer any right 
of appeal,” ſaid Schedoni.“ Why ſhould 
I ſave you from ſuſpicions, that may bring 
you to a ſtate like this, to which you have 
reduced me! 

&amp;© Your crimes have reduced you to it,” 
replied Nicola, © I have only done my 


duty, and that which another perſon 


could have eftected without my aid—the 
prieſt to whom Spalatro made his laſt 
conſeſſion.“ 

It is, however, a duty of ſuch a 
kind,” obſerved Vivaldi, © as I would not 
willingly have upon my conſcience. You 
have betrayed the life of your former 
friend, and have compelled me to aſſiſt in 
the deſtruction of a fellow being.” 

C You, like me, have aſſiſted to de- 
ſtroy a deſtroyer,” replied the monk.

ford you conſolation to know that you 
have not materially a{lificd iu his deſtruc— 


tion, I will hereafter give you proof for 
this aſſurance. There were other means 
of ſhewing that Schedoni was the Count 
di Bruno, than the teſtimony of Anſaldo, 
though I was ignorant of them when 1 
bade you ſummon the penitentiary.” 

If you had ſooner avowed this,” ſaid 
Vivaldi, „the aſſertion would have been 
more plauſible. Now, I can only under- 
ſtand that it is deſigned to win my tilence, 
and prevent my retorting upon you your 
own maxim—that he who has taken the 
life of another, deſerves to loſe his own.— 
To whom did thoſe garments belong?“ 

To myſelf, I repeat,” replied Nicola, 
„Schedoni can bear teſtimony that I re- 
ceived at Paluzzi a piſtol wound.” 

« Impoſlible,” ſaid Vivaldi, „I was 
armed only with my ſword !” 

£« NNO

© You had a companion,” obſerved the 
monk, „had not he fire- arms?“ 

Vivaldi, after a momentary confidera- 
tion, recollected that Paulo had piſtols, 
and that he had fired one beneath the 
arch of Paluzzi, on the firſt alarm occa- 
ſioned by the franger's voice. He im- 
mediately acknowledged the recollection. 
But I heard no groan, no ſymptom of 
diſtrets !”” he added. *© Befhdes, the gar- 
inents were at a conſiderable diſtance from 
ihe ſpot where the piſtol was fired! How 
could a perſon, ſo ſeverely wounded as 
thoſe garments indicated, have filently 
withdrawn to a remote dungeon, or, hav= 
ing done fo, is it probable he would have 
thrown aſide his dreſs !”? 

«&amp; All that is nevertheleſs true, re- 
plied Nicola, © My reſolution enabled me

eſcape from you, but you purſued me even

eoloured veſtments, in which I dared not 
return to my convent, and departed by a 
way which all your ingenuity failed to di- 
cover. The people who were already 1 tte 
fort, for the purpoſe o! fiſting to confine 
you and your ſervant du:ing the night on 
which Signora Roſalba was taken from 
Altieri, procured me another habit, and 
relicf for my wound. But, though I was 
unſeen by you during the night, I was 
not entirely unheard, for my groans 
reached you more than once from an ad- 
joining chamber, and my companions 
were entertained with the alarm which 
your ſervant teſtified. Are you now con- 
yinced ?” 

The groans were clearly remembered 
by Vivaldi, and many other circumſtances 
of Nicola's narration accorded fo well 
with others, which he recollected to have 
occurred on the night alluded to, that he 
had no longer a doubt of its veracity. 
The ſuddenneſs of Bianchi's death, how- 

ever, 


( 401 ) 


ever, ſtill occaſioned him ſuſpicions as to 
its cauſe ; yet Schedoni had declared not 
only that, he was innocent, but ignorant 
of this cauſe, which it appeared from his 
unwillingneſs to give teſtimony in favour 
of his agent, he would not have aitirmed, 
had he been conſcious that the monk was 


in any degree guilty in this inſtance. That 


Nicola could have no inducement for at- 
tempting the life of Bianchi other than a 
reward offered him by Schedoni, was 
clear; and Vivaldi, after more fully con- 
fidering theſe circumſtances, became con- 
vinced that her death was in conſequence 
of ſome incident of natural decay, 

While this converſation was paſſing, 
the Marcheſe, impaticnt to put a conclu— 
fion to it, and to leave the chamber, re- 
peatedly urged the ſecretary to diſpatch ; 
and, while he now earneſily renewed his 
requeſt, another voice anſwered for the 
ſecxetary, that he had nearly concluded, 


Viraldi thought that he had heard the

voice on ſome former occafion, and ©: 
turning his eyes upon the perſon who had 
ſpoken, diſcovered the ſtranger to be the 
fame who had firſt viſited him in priſon. 
Perceiving by his dreſs, that he was an 
officer of the Inquiſition, Vivaldi now 
underſtood too well the purport of lis 
former vilit, and that he had come with a 
deſign to betray him by affected ſympathy 
into a confeſſion of ſome heretical opinions. 
Similar inſtances of treachery Vivaldi had 
heard were frequently practiſed upon ac- 
cuſed perſons, but he had never fully be- 
heved ſuch cruelty poſſible till now, that 

it had been attempted towards himſelf. 
The viſit of this perſon bringing to his 
recollection the ſubſequent one he had 
received from Nicola, Vivaldi inquired 
whether the centinels had really admitted 
him to his cell, or he had entered it by 
other means; a queſtion to which the 
monk was ſilent, but the ſmile on his fea- 
tures, if ſa ſtrange an expreſſion deſerved 
to 


( +403 ) 


to be called a ſmile, ſeemed to reply, © Do 
you believe that I, a ſervant of the In- 
quifition, will betray its ſecrets 7” 

Vivaldi, however, urged the inquiry, 
tor he wiſhed to know whether the guard, 
who appeared to be faithful to their office, 
had eſcaped the puniſhment that was 
threatened. 

They were honeſt, replied Nicola, 
5 ſeek no further.“ 

« Are the tribunal convinced of their 
integrity ?” | 

Nicola ſmiled again in deriſion, and 
replied, © They never doubted it.” 

« How!“ faid Vivaldi. Why were 
theſe men put under arreſt, if their faith- 
fulneſs was not even ſuſpected ?” 

« Be ſatisfied with the knowledge, 
which expericnce has given you of the 
ſecrets of the Inquiſition,” replied Nicola 
ſolemnly, ** ſeck to know no more!“ 

It has terrible ſecrets!“ ſaid Schedoni,

priſoner has a concealed entrance, by 
winch the miniſters of death may paſs un- 
noticed to their victims. This Nicola is 
now one of thoſe dreadtu] ſummoners, and 
is acquainted with all the ſecret avenucs 
that lead to murder.” 

Vivaldi ſhrunk from Nicola in horror, 
and Schedoni pauſed; but while he had 
ſpoken, Vivaldi had again noticed the 
extraordinary change in his voice, and 
ſhuddered at its found no leſs than at the 
information it had given. Nicola was 
filent ; but his terrible eyes were fixed in 
vengeance on Schedoni. 

„ His office has been ſhort,” reſumed 
the Conſeſſor, turning his heavy eyes 
upon Nicola, and his taſk is almoſt 
done!“ As he pronounced the laſt words 
his voice faltered, but they were heard by 
the monk, who drawing nearer to the bed, 
demanded an explanation of them. A 


_ ghaſily ſmile triumphed in the features of 


Schedoni;

Schedoni; * Fear not but that an expla- 
nation will come full ſoon,“ ſaid he. 

Nicola fixed himſelf before the Con- 
ſeſſor, and bent his brows upon him as if 
he would have ſearched into his very ſoul. 
When Vivaldi again looked at Schedoni, 
he was ſhocked on obſerving the ſudden 
alteration of his countenance, yet ſtill a 
faint ſinile of triumph lingered there. But, 
while Vivaldi gazed, the features ſuddenly 
became agitaicd; in the next inſtant his 
whole frame was convulſed, and heavy 
groans laboured from his breaſt. Schedoni 
was now evidently dying. 

The Horror of Vivaldi, and of the Mar- 
cheſe, who endeavoured to Feave the 
chamber, was equalled only by the gene- 
ral contuſion that reigned there; every 
perſon preſent feemed to feel at leaſt a 
momentary compaſſion, except Nicola, 
who ſtood unmoved beſide Schedoni, and 
looked ſtedfaſtly upon his pangs, while a 
ſmile of derifion marked his countenance, 


As Vivaldi obſerved, with deteſtation,

this expreſſion, a ſlight ſpaſm darted over 
Nicola's face, and his muſcles alſo ſeemed 
to labour with ſudden contraction ; but 
the affection was tranſient, and vaniſhed 
as abruptly as it had appeared. The monk, 
however, turned from the miſerable ſpec- 
tacle before him, and as he turned he 
caught involuntarily at the arm of a perſon 
near him and leaned on his ſhoulder for 
ſupport. His manner appeared to betray 
that he had not been permitted to triump!: 
in the ſuiferings of his enemy, without 
participating at leaſt in their horror. 
Schedoni's ſtruggles now began to 
abate, and in a ſhort time he lay motion- 
les. When he uncloted his eyes, death 
was in them. He was {till nearly inſen- 
ſible; but preſently a faint gleam of re- 
collection ſhot from them, and gradually 
lighting them up, the character of his 
foul appeared there; the expreſſion was 
indeed feeble, but it was true. He moved 
his lips as if he would have ſpoken, and 
looked languidly round the chamber, 
ſeemingly

ſeemingly in ſearch of ſome perſon. At 
length, he uttercd a found, but he had not 
yet ſufficient command of his muſcles, to 
modulate that ſound into a word, till by 
repeated efforts the name of Nicola be- 
came intelligible. At the call, the monk, 
raiſed his head from the ſhoulder of the 
perſon on whom he had reclined, and 
turning round, Schedoni, as was evident 
from the ſudden change of expreſſion in 
his countenance, diſcovered him; his eyes, 
as they ſettled on Nicola ſcemed to recol- 
lect all their wonted fire, and the malig- 
| nant triumph, lately ſo prevalent in his 
phyſiognomy, again appeared as in the 
next moment he pointed to him. His 
, glance ſcemed ſuddenly impowered with” 
: the deſtructive faſcination attributed to 
y that of the baſilitk, for while 1t now met 
5 Nicola's, that monk ſeemed as if trans- 
18 fixed to the ſpot, and unable to withdraw 
his eyes from the glare of Schedoni's; in 
their expreſſion he read the dreadful ſen- 
tence of his fate, the triumph of revenge

and cunning. Struck with this terrible con- 
viction a pallid hue overſpread his face; 
at the ſame time an involuntary motion 
convulſed his features, cold trembling 
ſeized upon his frame, and, uttering a deep 
groan, he fell back, and was caught in 
the arms of the people near him. At the 
inſtant of his fall, Schedoni uttered a 
ſound ſo ſtrange and horrible, ſo convul- 
ſed, and ſo loud, fo exulting, yet ſo unlike 
any human voice, that every perſon in the 
chamber, except thoſe who were aſſiſting 
"Nicola, ſtruck with irreſiſtible terror, en- 
deavoured to make their way out of tt, 
This, however, was impracticable, for 


the door was faſtened, until a phyſician, 


who had been ſent for, ſhould arrive, and 


ſome inveſtigation could be made into this 


myſterious affair. The conſternation 1 
the Marcheſe and of Vivaldi, compelled 
to witneſs this ſcene of horror, cannot 
eaſily be imagined. 

Schedoni, having uttered that demo- 


niacal found of exultation, was not per- 
mitted 


( 409 ) 


mitted to repeat it, for the pangs he had 
lately ſuffered returned upon him, and 
he was again in ſtrong convulſions, when 
the phyſician entered the chamber. 'The 
moment he beheld Schedoni, he declared 
him to be poiſoned ; and he pronounced 
a ſimilar opinion on father Nicola ; affirm- 
ing alſo, that the drug, as appeared from 
the violence of the effect, was of too ſubtle 
and inveterate a nature to allow of anti- 
dote. He was, however, willing to ad- 
miniſter the medicine uſual in ſuch 
caſes. 

While he was giving orders to an at- 
tendant, with reſpect to this, the violence 
of Schedoni's convulſions once more re- 
laxed ; but Nicola appeared in the laſt 
extremity, His ſufferings were inceſſant, 
his ſenſes never for a moment returned, 
and he expired, before the medicine, which 
had been ſent for, could be brought. 
When it came, however, it was admini- 
ſtered with ſome ſucceſs to Schedoni, who

recovered not only his recollection, but 
his voice; and the firſt word he uttercd 
was, as formerly, tlie name of Nicola. 

«© Does he live?“ added the Conſeſſor 
with the utmoſt difficulty, and after a long 
pauſe. The perſons around him were 
filent, but the truth, which this ſilence 
indicated, ſeemed to revive him. 

The inquiſitor, who had attended, per— 
ceiving that Schedoni had recovered the 
uſe of his intellects, now judged it pru— 
dent to aſk ſome queſtions relative to his 
preſent condition, and to the cauſe of Ni- 
cola's death. | 

« Poiſon,” replied Sehedoni readily. 

« By whom adminiſtered ?” ſaid the 
iaquifitor, “ conſider that, while you an- 
ſwer, you are on your death-bed.” 

«© have no with to conceal the truth,” 
rejoined Schedoni, © nor the ſatisfaction, 
—he was obliged to pauſe, but preſently 
added, I havedeſtreyed lum, who wou'd 
have defiroyed me, and—and I have di- 
caped an ignominious death,”

fle pauſed again; it was with difficulty 
that he had ſaid thus much, and he was 
now overcome by the exertions he had 
made. The ſecretary, who had not been 
permitted to leave the chamber, was or- 
dered to note Schedont's words. 

&amp; You avow then,” continued the 1n- 
quiſitor, “ that the poiſon was admini— 
ſtered, both in the caſe of father Nicola 
and in your own, by yourſelf?“ 

Schedoni could not immediately reply: 
but when he did, he ſaid, „I avow it.“ 

Ile was aſked by what means he had 
contrived to procure the poiton, and was 
bidden to name his accomplice. 

„had no accomplice,” replied Schr- 
cont. 

“ Ilow did you procure the poiſon, 
then?“

replied, © It was concealed in my velt.

the inquiſitor, „ and confeſs the truth.

Me cannot believe what you have laſi 
aſſerted. It is improbable that you ſhould 
have had an opportunity of providing 
yourſelf with poiſon after your arreſt, and 
equally improbable that you ſhould have 
thought ſuch proviſion neceſſary before 
that period. Confeſs who is your ac- 
complice.” 

This accuſation of falſehood recalled 
the ſpirit of Schedom, which, contending 
with, and conquering, for a moment, cor=- 
poreal ſuffering, he ſaid in a firmer tone, 
&amp;« Tt was the poiſon, in which I dip my 
poniard, the better to defend me.” 

The inquiſitor ſmiled in contempt of 
this explanation, and Schedoni, obſerving 
him, defired a particular part of his veſt 
might be examined, where would be 
found ſome remains of the drug concealed, 
as he had affirmed. He was indulged in 
his requeſt, and the poiſon was diſcovered 
within a broad hem of his garment. 

Still it was inconceivable how he had 


CONs 


(413 } 


contrived to adminiſter it to Nicola, who, 
though he had been for ſome time alone 
with him on this day, would ſcarcely have 
ſo far confided in an enemy as to have 
accepted any ſceming ſuſtenance that 
might have been offered by him. The 
inquiſitor, ſtill anxious to diſcover an 
accomplice, atked Schedoni who had 
aſliſted to adminiſter the drug to Nicola; 
but the Confeflor was no longer in a 
condition to reply. Lite was now fin/:- 
ing apace ; the gleam of ſpirit and of 
character that had returned to his eyes, 
was departed, and left them haggard and 
fixed; and preſently a livid corſe was all 
that remained of the once terrible Sche-

While this awful event had been ac-

of his preſent ſituation to himſelf; but 
Vivaldi, in an agony of horror, had beet 
calling inceſſantly for the medicine, which 
might poſſibly afford ſome relief to the 
anguiſh he witneſſed; and when it was 
brought, he had aſſiſted to ſupport the ſuſ- 
ferers. 

At length, now that the worſt was 
over, and when the ſeveral witneſtes had 
ſigned to the laſt arowal of Schedoni, 
every perſon in the chamber was ſuffered 
to depart; and Vivaldi was re- conducted 
to his priſon, accompanied by the Mar- 
cheſe, where he was to remain till the 
deciſion of the holy office reſpecting his 
innocence, as aſſerted by the depoſition of 
Schedoni, ſhould be known. He was 
too much affected by the late ſcene to 
give the Marcheſe any explanation at 
preſent, reſpecting the family of Ellena 
di Rofalba ; and the Marcheſe, having re- 
mained for ſome time with his ſon, with- 
drew to the reſidence of his friend.

SHAKESPEARE, 


Ix conſequence of the dying confeſſion of 
Schedoni, an order was tent from the 
| holy office for ine reteaie of Vivaldi, with- 
in a few days after the death of the Con- 
feſflor; and the Marcheſe conducted his 
fon from the priſons of the Inquiſition to 
the manſion of his friend, the Count di 
Maro, with whom he had reſided ſince 
his arrival at Rome. | 
While they were receiving the ceremo- 
nious congratulations of the Count, and 
of ſome nobles aſſembled to welcome the 
emancipated prifoner, a loud voice was 
heard from the ante-chamber, exclaiming, 
Let me paſs! It is my maſter, let mc

me, be ſent to the Inquifition themſelves!“ 

In the next inſtant Paulo burſt into the 
ſaloon, followed by a group of lacqueys, 
who, however, pauſed at the door, fear- 
ful of the diſpleaſure of their lord, ye! 
ſcarcely able to ſtifle a laugh; while Paulo. 
ſpringing forward, had nearly overſet ſome 
of the company, who happened at that 
moment to be bowing with profound joy 
to Vivaldi. 

« It is my maſter! it is my dear maſter !” 
cried Paulo, and, ſending off a nobleman 
with cach elbow, as he made his way be- 
tween them, he hugged Vivaldi in his 
arms, repeating, © O, my maſter! my 
maſter !” till a paſſion of joy and affection 
overcame his voice, and he fell at his maſ- 
ter's feet and wept. 

This was a moment of finer ſatisfaction 
to Vivaldi, than he had known fince his 
meeting with his father ; and he was too 
much intereſted by his faithful ſervant, to 

have 


1 


have leiſure to apologize to the aſtoniſhed 
company for his rudeneſs. While the 
lacqueys were repairing the miſchief Paulo 
had occaſioned, were picking up the rol- 
ling ſnuff-boxes he had jerked away in 
his paſſage, and wiping the ſnuff from the 
foiled clothes, Vivaldi was participating in 
all the delight, and returning all the affec- 
tion of his ſervant, and was ſo wholly occu- 
pied by theſe pleaſurable feelings as ſcarce- 
ly to be ſenſible that any perſons beſides 
themſelves were in the room. 'The Mar- 
cheſe, meanwhile, was making a thouſand 
apologies for the diſaſters Paulo had occa- 
ſioned; was alternately calling upon him 
to recollect in whoſe preſence he was, 
and to quit the apartment immediately; 
explaining to the company that he had 
not ſeen Vivaldi fince they were together 
in the Inquiſition,, and remarking pro- 
foundly, that he was much attached to 
his maſter. But Paulo, inſenſible to the

repeated commands of the Marcheſe, and 
to the endeavours of Vivaldi to raiſe him, 
was ſtill pouring forth his whole heart 
at his maſter's fect. ** Ah! 'my Signor,“ 
faid he, “if you could but know how 
miſerable I was when I got out of the 
Inquiſition !” 

He raves !” obſerved the Count to 
the Marcheſe, “ you perceive that joy has 
Tendered him delirious !” 

% How I wandered about the walls 
half the night, and what it colt me to 
leave them! But when I loſt fight of 
them, Signor, O! San Dominico ! I 
thought my heart would have broke. I 
had a great mind to have gone back again 
and given myſelf up; and, perhaps, I 
ſhould too, if it had not been for my 
friend, the centinel, who eſcaped with 
me, and I would not do him au injury, 
poor fellow ! for he meant nothing but 

kindneſs when he let me out, And, ſure

Enough, as it has proved, it was all for 
the heſt; for now I am here too, Signor, 
as well as you; and can tell you all I felt 


when 1 believed I ſhould never ſee you 


again.“ 


The contraſt of his preſent joy to 


his remembered grief again brought 
tears into Paulo's eyes; he ſmiled and 
wept, and ſobbed and laughed with 
ſuch rapid tranſition, that Vivaldi began 
to be alarmed for him; when, ſuddenly 
becoming calm, he looked up in his 
maſter's face and taid gravely, but with 
eagerneſs, © Pray Signor, was not the 
root of your little priſon peaked, and was 
there not a little turret ſtuck up at one 
corner of it? and was there not a battle- 
ment round the turret? and was there 
not —— Vivaldi, after regarding him tor 


a moment, replied imilingly, Why 
truly, my good Paulo, my dungeon was 
fo far from the roof, that I never had an 
opportunity of oblerving it.“ 8

6“ That is very true, Signor,“ replied 
Paulo, very true indeed; but I did not 
happen to think of that. I am certain, 
though, it was as I ſay, and I was ſure of 
it at the time. O Signor! I thought that 
roof would have broke my heart ; O how 
I did look at it! and now to think that 
I am here, with my dear maſter once 
again !” 

As Paulo concluded, his tears and ſobs 
returned with more violence than before; 
and Vivaldi, who could not perceive any 
neceſſary connection between this mention 
of the roof of his late prifon and the joy 
his ſervant expreſſed on ſeeing him again, 
began to fear that his ſenſes were bew1l- 
dered, and defired an explanation of his 
words. Paulo's account, rude and ſimple 
as it was, ſoon diſcovered to him the rela- 
tion of theſe apparently heterogeneous cir- 
cumſtances to each other; when Vivaldi, 
overcome by this new inſtance of the 
power of Paulo's affection, embraced him 

with 


( 421 ) 


with his whole heart, and, compelling 
him to riſe, preſented him to the aſſembly 
as his faithful friend and chief deliverer. 
The Marcheſe, affected by the ſcene he 
had witneſſed, and with the truth of 
Vivaldi's words, condeſcended to give 
Paulo a hearty ſhake by the hand, and to 
thank him warmly for the bravery and 
fidelity he had diſplayed in his maſter's 
intereſt. © I never can fully reward your 
attachment,” added the Marcheſe, © but 


what remains for me to do, ſhall be done. 


From this moment I make you indepen- 
dent, and promiſe, in the preſence of this 
noble company, to give you a thouſand 
ſequins, as ſome acknowledgement of 
your ſervices.” 

Paulo did not expreſs all the gratitude 
for this gift which the Marcheſe expected. 
He ſtammered, and bowed, and bluſhed, 
and at length burſt into tears; and when 
Vivaldi inquired what diſtreſſed him, he 
replied, 4+ Why, Signor, of what uſe are 

the 


wer 


( 422 ) 


the thouſand ſequins to me, if I am to be 
independent! what uſe, if I am not to ſtay 
with you?“ 

Vivaldi cordially aſſured Paulo, that 
he ſhould always remain with him, and 
that he ſhould confider it as his duty to 
render his future life happy. © You ſhall 
henceforth,” added Vivaldi, &lt; be placed 
at the head of my houſehold ; the manage- 
ment of my ſervants, and the whole con- 
duct of my domeſtic concerns, ſhall be 
committed to you, as a proot of my entire 
confidence in your integrity and attach- 
ment; and becauſe this is a fituation 
which will allow you to be always near 


77 


me. 

« Thank you, my Signor,“ replied 
Paulo, in a voice rendered almoſt jnarti- 
culate by his gratitude, ** Thank you with 
my whole heart! if I ſtay with you, that 
is enough for me, I aſk no more. But 1 
hope my Lord Marcheſe will not think 


me ungrateſul for refuſing to accept of the 
thou- 


( 423 ) 


thouſand ſequins he was ſo kind as to offer 
me, if I would but be independent, for I 
thank bim as much as if J had received 
them, and a great deal more too.” 

The Marcheſe, ſmiling at Paulo's miſ- 
take, rejoined, © As I do not perceive, my 
good friend, how your remaining with 
your maſter can be a circumſtance to 
diſqualify you ſrom accepting a thouſand 
fequins, I command you, on pain of my 
diſpleature, to receive them; and when- 
ever you marry, I ſhall expect that you 
will ſhew your obedience to me again, by 
accepting another thouſand from me with 
your wife, as her dower.” 

&amp; This is too much, Signor,“ faid 
Paulo tobbing—** too much to be borne!“ 
and ran out of the ſaloon. But amidſt 
the murmur of applauſe which his con- 
duct drew from the noble ſpectators, for 
Paulo's warm heart had ſubdued even the 
coldneſs of their pride, a convulſive found 
from the ante-chamber betrayed the excels 

ot 


( 424 ) 


of emotion, which he had thus abruptly 
withdrawn himſelf to conceal. 

In a few hours, the Marcheſe and Vi- 
valdi took leave of their friends, and ſet 
out for Naples, where they arrived, with 
out any interruption, on the fourth day. 
But it was a melancholy journey to Vi- 
valdi, notwithſtanding the joy of his late 
eſcape; for the Marcheſe, having intro- 
duced the mention of his attachment to 
Ellena di Roſalba, informed him, that, 
under the preſent unforeſeen circum- 
ſtances, he could not conſider his late 
engagement to the Marcheſa on that ſub- 
ject as binding, and that Vivaldi muſt 
relinquiſh Ellena, if it ſhould appear that 
ſhe really was the daughter of the late 
Schedoni. 

Immediately on his arrival at Naples, 
however, Vivaldi, with a degree of im- 
patience, to which his utmoſt ſpeed was 
inadequate, and with a revived joy ſo 
powerful as to overcome every ſear, and 
every 


( 425 ) 


cvery melancholy conſideration, which 
the late converſation with his father had 
occaſioned, haſtened to the Santa della 
Pita. 

Ellena heard his voice from the grate, 
inquiring for her of a nun, who was in 
the parlour, and in the next inſtant they 
beheld each other yet once again. 

In ſuch a meeting, after the Jong un- 
certainty and terror, which each had ſuf- 
fered for the fate of the other, and the 
dangers and hardſhips they had really in- 
curred, joy was exalted almoſt to agony. 
Ellena wept, and ſome minutes paſſed 
before ſhe could anſwer to Vivaldi's few 
words of tender exclamation : it was long 
ere ſhe was tranquil enough to obſerve 
the alteration which ſevere confinement 
had given to his appearance. The ani- 
mated expreſſion of his countenance was 
unchanged; yet, when the firſt glow of 


joy had faded from it, and Ellena had

During this interview, he related, at 
Ellena's requeſt, the particulars of his 
adventures, ſince he had been ſeparated 
from her in the chapel of San Scbaſtian ; 
but, when he came to that part of the 
narration where it was neceſlary to men- 
tion Schedoni, he pauſed in unconquer- 
able embarraſſinent and a diſtreſs not 
unmingled with horror. Vivaldi could. 
ſcarcely endure even to hint to Ellena any 
part of the unjuſt conduct, which the - 
Confeſſor had practiſed towards him, yet 
it was impoſlible to conclude his account 
without expreſſing much more than hints; 
nor could he bear to a lict her with 
a knowledge of the death of him who he 
believed to be her parent, however the 
dreadful circumſtances of that event might 
be concealed, His embarraſiment be- 
came obvious, and was ſtill increaſed by 
Ellena's inquiries, |

At length, as an introduction to the 
information it was necahary to give, and 
to the fuller explanation he wifhed to 
receive upon a ſubject, which, though it 
was the one that prefied molt anxiouſly 
upon his mind, he had not yet dared to 
mention, Vivaldi ventured to declare his 
knowledge of her having diſcovered her 
parent to be living. The ſatisfaction im- 
mediately apparent upon Ellena's counte- 
nance heightened his diſtreſs, and it» 7% 
luctance to proceed; believing, as he did, 
that the event he had to communicate mult 
change her gladneſs to grief. 

Ellena, however, upon this mention of 
a topic ſo intereſting to them both, pro- 
ceeded to expreſs the happineſs the had re- 
ceived from the diſcovery of a parent, whole 
virtues had even won her affection long be-

Schedoni, of whom he believed her to 
ſpeak, having certainly never been adapt- 
ed to inſpire tenderneſs. But his ſurprize 
ſoon changed its object, when Olivia, 
who had heard that a ſiranger was at the 
grate, entered the parlour, and was an- 
nounced as the mother of Ellena di Ro- 
ſalba. 

Before Vivaldi left the convent, a ſull 
explanation, as to family, was given on 
both fides, when he had the infinite ;oy 
of learning, that Ellena was not the 
daughter of Schedoni ; and Olivia had 
the ſatisfaction to know that ſhe had no 
future evil to apprehend from him who 
had hitherto been her worſt enemy. The 
manner of his death, however, with all 
the circumſtances of his character, as un- 
folded by the late trial, Vivaldi was care- 
ful to conceal. 

When Ellena had withdrawn from the 
room, Vivaldi made a full acknowledg- 
ment to Olivia of his long attachment to 
| Fees her 


64 


her daughter, and ſupplicated for her 
conſent to their marriage. To this ap- 
plication, however, Olivia replied, that, 
though ſhe had been no ſtranger to 
their mutual affection, or to the ſeveral 
circumſtances which had both proved its 
durability, and tried their fortitude, ſhe 
never could conſent that her daughter 
ſhould become a member of any family, 
whoſe principal was either inſenfible of 
her value, or unwilling to acknowledge 
it; and that in this inſtance it would be 
neceſſary to Vivaldi's ſucceſs, not only 
that he, but that his father ſhould be 
a ſuitor; on which condition only, ſhe 
allowed him to hope for her acquieſ- 
cence. | 

Such a ſtipulation ſcarcely chilled the 1 
hopes of Vivaldi, now that Ellena was ; 
proved to be the daughter not of the 
murderer Schedoni, but of a Count dy i 
Bruno, who had been no leſs reſpectable 
in character than in rank; and he had 


little 


( 430 ) 


little doubt that his father would conſent 


to fulfil! ihe promiſe he had given to the 
dying Marcheſa. 

In this belief he was not miſtaken. 
The Marcheſe, having attended to Vi- 
valdi's account of Ellena's family, pro- 
miſled, that if it ſhould appear there was 
no ſecond miſtake on the ſubject, he 
would not longer oppoſe the wiſhes of 
his ſon. 

The Marcheſe immediately caufcd a 
private inquiry to he made as to the 
identity of Olivia, the pretent Countets 
di Bruno; and, though this was not 
purſued without difficulty, the phyſi— 
clan, who had afſiſted in the plan of 
her eſcape from the cruclty of Ferando 
di Bruno, and who was living, as well as 
Beatrice, who clearly remembered the ſiſter 
of her late miſtreſs, at length rendered 
Olivia's identity unqueſtionable. Now, 
therefore, that the Marcheſe's every doubt 
was removed, he paid a viſit to La Piet,

and ſolicited, in due form, Olivia's con- 


ſent to the nuptials of Vivaldi with El- 


lena; which ſhe granted him with an 
entire ſatistaction. In this interview, the 
Marcheſe was ſo much faſcinated by the 
manners of the Counteſs, and pleaſed 
with the delicacy and ſweetneſs, which an- 
peared i: tnvie of Ellena, that his con- 
tent was n longer a conſtrained one, and 
he willingly relinquiihed the views of ſu—

merly looked to for his ſon, tor thoſe of 


virtue and permanent happineis that were

which her preſent ſituation oppoſed to 
them, drew tears of tender joy and gra-

ſaw Vivaldi for the laſt time; now, ſup-

no more; and, as a recolle&amp;ion of the

for ſuccour, ſupplicated even to hear his

of that moment was now remembered,

Ellena became more than ever ſenſible of

Olivia, in thus relinquiſhing her daugh-

the fair proſpect of happineſs that open -

ing, that, though ſhe relinquiſhed, ſhe

of Vivaldi's reſidence to La Pizza would 
permit a frequent intercourſe with the

Tur fete which, ſome time after the 
nuptials, was given by the Marcheſe in 
celebration of them, was held at a de- 
lightful villa, belonging to Vivaldi, a few 
miles diſtant from Naples, upon the bor- 
der of the gulf, and on the oppoſite ſhore 
to that which had been the frequent abode 
of the Marcheſa. The beauty of its fitu- 
ation and its interior elegance induced 
Vivaldi and Ellena to ſelect it as their 
chief reſidence. It was, in truth, a ſcene 
of fairy-land, The pleaſure-grounds ex- 

71 2 tended 


( 436 ) 


tended over a valley, which opened to the 
bay, and the houſe ſtood at the entrance 
of this valley, upon a gentle ſlope that 
margined the water, and commanded the 
whole extent of its luxuriant ſhores, from 
the lofty cape of Miſeno to the bold 
mountains of the ſouth, which, ſtretching 
acroſs the diſtance, appeared to riſe out of 
the fea, and divided the gulf of Naples 
from that of Salerno. 

The marble porticoes and arcades of the 
villa were ſhadowed by groves of the beau- 
tiſul magnolia, flowering aſh, cedrati, ca- 
mellias, and majeſtic palms; and the cool 
and airy halls, opening on two oppoſite 
ſides to a colonnade, admitted beyond the 
rich foilage all the ſeas and ſhores of 
Naples, from the weſt; and to the eaſt, 
views of the valley of the domain, with- 
drawing among winding hills wooded to 
their ſummits, except where clifts of va- 


Tious-coloured granites, yellow, green, 
and

and purple, liſted their tall heads, and 


tbrew gay gleams of light amidſt tlie 


umbrageous landſcape. 

The ſtyle of the gardens, where lawns 
and groves, and woods, varied the undu- 
lating ſurface, was that of England, and 
of the preſent day, rather than of Italy; 
except © where a long alley peeping 
on the main,” exhibited ſuch gigantic 
loftineſs of ſhade, and grandeur of 
perſpective, as characterize the Italian 
taſte. 

On this jubilee, every avenue, and 
grove, and pavilion, was richly illumi- 
nated, The villa itſelf, where each airy 
hall and arcade was reſplendent with 
lights, and laviſhly decorated with flow- 
ers and the moſt beautiful ſhrubs, whoſe 
buds ſeemed to pour all Arabia's perfumes 
on the air,—this villa reſembled a fabric 
called up by enchantment, rather than a 
ſtructure of human art.

The dreſſes of the higher rank of viſt- 
tors were as ſplendid as the ſcenery, of 
which Ellena was, in every reſpect, the 
queen. But this entertainment was not 
given to perſons of diſtinction only; for 
both Vivaldi and Ellena had wiſhed that 
all the tenants of the domain ſhould par- 
take of it, and ſhare the abundant hap- 
pineſs which themſelves poſſeſſed ; fo that 
the grounds, which were extenſive enough 
to accommodate each rank, were relin- 
quiſhed to a general gaiety. Paulo was, 
on this occaſion, a ſort of maſter of the 
revels; and, ſurrounded by a party of his 
own particular ailociates, danced once 
more, as he had ſo often wiſhed, upon 
the moon-light ſhore of Naples. 

As Vivaldi and Ellena were paſſing the 
ſpot which Paulo had choſen for the ſcene 
of his feſtivity, they pauſed to obſerve 
his ſtrange capers and extravagant geſticu- 
lation, as he mingled in the dance, while 
every now-and-then he ſhouted forth, 

though 


( 439 ) 


though half breathleſs with the heartinefs | 


of the exerciſe, © O! giorno felice! O! 
giorno felice !” 

On perceiving Vivaldi, and the ſmiles 
with which he and Ellena regarded him, 
he quitted his ſports, and advancing, 
«© Ah! my dear maſter,” faid he, do 
you remember the night, when we were 
travelling on the banks of the Celano, 
before that diabolical accident happened 
in the chapel of San Sebaſtian; don't 
you remember how thoſe people, who 
were tripping it away. ſo joyoufly, by 
moonlight, reminded me of Naples and 
the many merry dances I had footed on 
the beach here?“ | 

« I remember it well,” replied Vi- 
valdi. 

« Ah! Signor mo, you ſaid at the 
time, that you hoped we ſhould ſoon be 
here, and that then I ſhould friſł it away 
with as glad a heart as the beſt of them, 
The firſt part of your hope, my dear 

maſter,

maſter, you was out in, for, as it hap- 
pened, we had to go through purgatory 
before we could reach paradiſe ; but the 
fecond part is come at laft ;—for here [ 
am, ſure enough ! dancing by moonlight, 
in my own dear bay of Naples, with my 
own dear maſter and miſtreſs, in ſafety, and 
as happy almeg/t as myſelf; and with that 
old mountain yonder, Veſuvius, which I, 
forſooth! thought I was never to ſee 
again, ſpouting up fire, juſt as it uſed 
to do before we got ourſelves put into the 
Inquiſition! O! who could have fore- 
ſeen all this! O! giorno felice! O! 
giorno felice ” | 

* I rejoice in your happineſs, my good 
Paulo,” ſaid Vivaldi, « almoſt as much 
as in my own; though I do not entirely 
agree with you as to the comparative 
proportion of each.” 

„Paulo!“ ſaid Ellena, IJ am in- 
debted to you beyond any ability to re- 


I

pay; for to your intrepid affection your 
maſter owes his preſent ſafety. I will not 
attempt to thank you for your attach 
ment to him; my care of your welfare ſhall 
prove how well I know it; but I wiſh to 
give to all your friends this acknowledg- 
ment of your worth, and of my ſenſe of 
wt.” 

Paulo bowed, and ſtammered, and 
writhed and bluſhed, and was unable to 
reply: till, at length, given a ſudden 
and lofty ſpring from the ground, the 
emotion, which had nearly ſtifled him, 
burſt forth in words, and “ O! giorno 
' felice! O] giorno felice!” flew from his 
lips with the force of an electric ſhock. 
They communicated his enthuſiaſm to 
the whole company; the words paſſed 
like lightening from one individual to ano- 
ther, till Vivaldi and Ellena withdrew 
amidſt a choral ſhout, and all the woods 
and ſtrands of Naples re-echoed with— 
« Q! giorno felice! O! giorno felice!“

« You ſce,” faid Paulo, when they had 
departed, and he came to himſelf again, 
* you ſee how people get through their 
misfortunes, if they have but a heart to 
bear up againſt them, and do nothing 
that can lie on their conſcience afterwards ; 
and how ſuddenly one comes to be happy, 
juſt, perhaps, when one is beginning to 
think one never is to be happy again! 
Who would have gueſſed that my dear 
maſter and I, when we were clapped up 
in that diabolical place, the Inquiſition, 
ſhould ever come out again into this 
world! Who would have gueſſed, when 
we were taken before thoſe old devils of 
Inquiſitors, fitting there all of a row in a 
place under ground, hung with black, 
and nothing but torches all around, and 
faces grinning at us, that looked as black 
as the gentry aforeſaid; and when I was 
not ſo much as ſuffercd to open my mouth; 
no! they would not let me open my mouth 
to my maſter !—who, I ſay, would have 
gueſſed

gueſſed we ſhould ever be let looſe again! 
who would have thought we ſhould ever 
know what it is to be happy ! Yet here we 
are all abroad once more! All at liberty! 
And may run, if we will, ſtraight ſorward, 
from one end of the carth to the other, 
and back again without being ſtopped ! 
May fly in the ſea, or ſwim in the ſky, 
or tumble over head and heels into the 
moon! For remember, my good friends, 
we have no lead in our conſciences to 
keep us down!“ 

«© You mean ſwim in the ſea, and fly 
in the ſky, I ſuppoſe,” obſerved a grave 


perſonage near him, but as for tumbling 
over head and heels into the moon! I 


don't know what you mean by that!” 

« Pſhaw !” replied Paulo, „who can 
ſtop, at ſuch a time as this, to think 
about what he means! I wiſh that all 
thoſe, who on this night are not merry 
enough to ſpeak before they think, may 
ever after be grave enough to think before 

they

they ſpeak ! But you, none of you, no! 
not one of you! I warrant, ever ſaw the 
roof of a priſon, when your maſter hap- 


pened to be below in the dungeon, nor 


know what it 1s to be forced to run away, 
and leave him behind to die by himſelf. 
Poor ſouls! But no matter for that, you 
can be tolerably happy, perhaps, notwith- 
ſtanding; but as for gueſſing how happy 
I am, or knowing any thing about the 
matter, O! its quite beyond. what you 
can underſtand. O giorno felice! O! 
giorno felice!” repeated Paulo, as he 
bounded forward to mingle in the dance, 
and O giorno ſelice!” was again ſhout- 
ed in chorus by his joyful-companions,
