# Jane Austen as a Gothic Novelist

This is an independent project exploring the similarity in Austen's writing style to popular gothic novelist Ann Radcliffe. Austen's Northanger Abbey is known as a parody of the widely-circulated gothic novels of her day. However, despite her critique of the gothic novels, Austen herself also enjoyed these books. A comparison between the two authors' texts using text mining methods is a quantitative method of exploring the strength of similarities between the writing styles of the two authors. 

The cleaned data files are attached in separated folders along with the code.
